<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch1'>A FRIEND OF NAPOLEON</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>LL Paris held no happier man than Papa Chibou.
He loved his work—that was why. Other men
might say—did say, in fact—that for no amount
of money would they take his job; no, not for ten
thousand francs for a single night. It would turn
their hair white and give them permanent goose flesh,
they averred. On such men Papa Chibou smiled with
pity. What stomach had such zestless ones for adventure?
What did they know of romance? Every
night of his life Papa Chibou walked with adventure
and held the hand of romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every night he conversed intimately with Napoleon;
with Marat and his fellow revolutionists; with
Carpentier and Cæsar; with Victor Hugo and Lloyd
George; with Foch and with Bigarre, the Apache
murderer whose unfortunate penchant for making
ladies into curry led him to the guillotine; with
Louis XVI and with Madame Lablanche, who
poisoned eleven husbands and was working to make
it an even dozen when the police deterred her;
with Marie Antoinette and with sundry early Christian
martyrs who lived in sweet resignation in electric-lighted
catacombs under the sidewalk of the Boulevard
des Capucines in the very heart of Paris. They
were all his friends and he had a word and a joke for
each of them as, on his nightly rounds, he washed
their faces and dusted out their ears, for Papa Chibou
was night watchman at the Museum Pratoucy—“The
World in Wax. Admission, one franc. Children and
soldiers, half price. Nervous ladies enter the Chamber
of Horrors at their own risk. One is prayed
not to touch the wax figures or to permit dogs to
circulate in the establishment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been at the Museum Pratoucy so long that
he looked like a wax figure himself. Visitors not
infrequently mistook him for one and poked him
with inquisitive fingers or canes. He did not undeceive
them; he did not budge; Spartanlike he stood
stiff under the pokes; he was rather proud of being
taken for a citizen of the world of wax, which was,
indeed, a much more real world to him than the
world of flesh and blood. He had cheeks like the
small red wax pippins used in table decorations,
round eyes, slightly poppy, and smooth white hair,
like a wig. He was a diminutive man and, with his
horseshoe mustache of surprizing luxuriance, looked
like a gnome going to a fancy-dress ball as a small
walrus. Children who saw him flitting about the
dim passages that led to the catacombs were sure
he was a brownie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His title “Papa” was a purely honorary one,
given him because he had worked some twenty-five
years at the museum. He was unwed, and slept at
the museum in a niche of a room just off the Roman
arena where papìer-mâché lions and tigers breakfasted
on assorted martyrs. At night, as he dusted off
the lions and tigers, he rebuked them sternly for their
lack of delicacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” he would say, cuffing the ear of the largest
lion, which was earnestly trying to devour a grandfather
and an infant simultaneously, “sort of a pig
that you are! I am ashamed of you, eater of babies.
You will go to hell for this, Monsieur Lion, you may
depend upon it. Monsieur Satan will poach you
like an egg, I promise you. Ah, you bad one, you
species of a camel, you Apache, you profiteer——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Papa Chibou would bend over and very tenderly
address the elderly martyr who was lying beneath
the lion’s paws and exhibiting signs of distress,
and say, “Patience, my brave one. It does not
take long to be eaten, and then, consider: The good
Lord will take you up to heaven, and there, if you
wish, you yourself can eat a lion every day. You
are a man of holiness, Phillibert. You will be Saint
Phillibert, beyond doubt, and then won’t you laugh
at lions!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phillibert was the name Papa Chibou had given
to the venerable martyr; he had bestowed names on
all of them. Having consoled Phillibert, he would
softly dust the fat wax infant whom the lion was
in the act of bolting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Courage, my poor little Jacob,” Papa Chibou
would say. “It is not every baby that can be eaten
by a lion; and in such a good cause too. Don’t
cry, little Jacob. And remember: When you get
inside Monsieur Lion, kick and kick and kick! That
will give him a great sickness of the stomach. Won’t
that be fun, little Jacob?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he went about his work, chatting with them
all, for he was fond of them all, even of Bigarre
the Apache and the other grisly inmates of the Chamber
of Horrors. He did chide the criminals for their
regrettable proclivities in the past and warn them
that he would tolerate no such conduct in his museum.
It was not his museum of course. Its owner was
Monsieur Pratoucy, a long-necked, melancholy marabou
of a man who sat at the ticket window and took
in the francs. But, though the legal title to the place
might be vested in Monsieur Pratoucy, at night Papa
Chibou was the undisputed monarch of his little
wax kingdom. When the last patron had left and the
doors were closed Papa Chibou began to pay calls
on his subjects; across the silent halls he called greetings
to them:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Bigarre, you old rascal, how goes the world?
And you, Madame Marie Antoinette, did you enjoy
a good day? Good evening, Monsieur Cæsar; aren’t
you chilly in that costume of yours? Ah, Monsieur
Charlemagne, I trust your health continues to be of
the best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His closest friend of them all was Napoleon. The
others he liked; to Napoleon he was devoted. It was
a friendship cemented by the years, for Napoleon had
been in the museum as long as Papa Chibou. Other
figures might come and go at the behest of a fickle
public, but Napoleon held his place, albeit he had
been relegated to a dim corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not much of a Napoleon. He was smaller
even than the original Napoleon, and one of his ears
had come in contact with a steam radiator and as
a result it was gnarled into a lump the size of a
hickory nut; it was a perfect example of that phenomenon
of the prize ring, the cauliflower ear. He
was supposed to be at St. Helena and he stood on
a papier-mâché rock, gazing out wistfully over a
nonexistent sea. One hand was thrust into the bosom
of his long-tailed coat, the other hung at his side.
Skin-tight breeches, once white but white no longer,
fitted snugly over his plump bump of waxen abdomen.
A Napoleonic hat, frayed by years of conscientious
brushing by Papa Chibou, was perched
above a pensive waxen brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou had been attracted to Napoleon from
the first. There was something so forlorn about him.
Papa Chibou had been forlorn, too, in his first days
at the museum. He had come from Bouloire, in the
south of France, to seek his fortune as a grower of
asparagus in Paris. He was a simple man of scant
schooling and he had fancied that there were asparagus
beds along the Paris Boulevards. There were
none. So necessity and chance brought him to the
Museum Pratoucy to earn his bread and wine, and
romance and his friendship for Napoleon kept him
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first day Papa Chibou worked at the museum
Monsieur Pratoucy took him round to tell him about
the figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This,” said the proprietor, “is Toulon, the strangler.
This is Mademoiselle Merle, who shot the Russian
duke. This is Charlotte Corday, who stabbed
Marat in the bathtub; that gory gentleman is Marat.”
Then they had come to Napoleon. Monsieur Pratoucy,
was passing him by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who is this sad-looking gentleman?” asked
Papa Chibou.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Name of a name! Do you not know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But no, monsieur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that is Napoleon himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, his first in the museum, Papa Chibou
went round and said to Napoleon, “Monsieur, I do
not know with what crimes you are charged, but I,
for one, refuse to think you are guilty of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So began their friendship. Thereafter he dusted
Napoleon with especial care and made him his confidant.
One night in his twenty-fifth year at the
museum Papa Chibou said to Napoleon, “You observed
those two lovers who were in here tonight,
did you not, my good Napoleon? They thought it
was too dark in this corner for us to see, didn’t they?
But we saw him take her hand and whisper to her.
Did she blush? You were near enough to see. She
is pretty, isn’t she, with her bright dark eyes? She
is not a French girl; she is an American; one can
tell that by the way she doesn’t roll her <span class='it'>r</span>’s. The
young man, he is French; and a fine young fellow
he is, or I’m no judge. He is so slender and erect,
and he has courage, for he wears the war cross; you
noticed that, didn’t you? He is very much in love,
that is sure. This is not the first time I have seen
them. They have met here before, and they are wise,
for is this not a spot most romantic for the meetings
of lovers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou flicked a speck of dust from Napoleon’s
good ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” he exclaimed, “it must be a thing most delicious
to be young and in love. Were you ever
in love, Napoleon? No? Ah, what a pity! I know,
for I, too, have had no luck in love. Ladies prefer
the big, strong men, don’t they? Well, we must
help these two young people, Napoleon. We must
see that they have the joy we missed. So do not
let them know you are watching them if they come
here tomorrow night. I will pretend I do not see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each night after the museum had closed, Papa
Chibou gossiped with Napoleon about the progress
of the love affair between the American girl with the
bright dark eyes and the slender, erect young Frenchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All is not going well,” Papa Chibou reported one
night, shaking his head. “There are obstacles to
their happiness. He has little money, for he is just
beginning his career. I heard him tell her so tonight.
And she has an aunt who has other plans for her.
What a pity if fate should part them! But you
know how unfair fate can be, don’t you, Napoleon?
If we only had some money we might be able to help
him, but I, myself, have no money, and I suppose
you, too, were poor, since you look so sad. But
attend; tomorrow is a day most important for them.
He had asked her if she will marry him, and she
has said that she will tell him tomorrow night at
nine in this very place. I heard them arrange it all.
If she does not come it will mean no. I think we
shall see two very happy ones here tomorrow night,
eh, Napoleon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next night when the last patron had gone and
Papa Chibou had locked the outer door, he came to
Napoleon, and tears were in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw, my friend?” broke out Papa Chibou.
“You observed? You saw his face and how pale it
grew? You saw his eyes and how they held a thousand
agonies? He waited until I had to tell him
three times that the museum was closing. I felt
like an executioner, I assure you; and he looked up
at me as only a man condemned can look. He went
out with heavy feet; he was no longer erect. For she
did not come, Napoleon; that girl with the bright
dark eyes did not come. Our little comedy of love
has become a tragedy, monsieur. She has refused
him, that poor, that unhappy young man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following night at closing time Papa Chibou
came hurrying to Napoleon; he was a-quiver with
excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was here!” he cried. “Did you see her?
She was here and she kept watching and watching;
but, of course, he did not come. I could tell from
his stricken face last night that he had no hope.
At last I dared to speak to her. I said to her,
‘Mademoiselle, a thousand pardons for the very great
liberty I am taking, but it is my duty to tell you—he
was here last night and he waited till closing
time. He was all of a paleness, mademoiselle, and
he chewed his fingers in his despair. He loves you,
mademoiselle; a cow could see that. He is devoted
to you; and he is a fine young fellow, you can take
an old man’s word for it. Do not break his heart,
mademoiselle.’ She grasped my sleeve. ‘You know
him, then?’ she asked. ‘You know where I can find
him?’ ‘Alas, no,’ I said. ‘I have only seen him here
with you.’ ‘Poor boy!’ she kept saying. ‘Poor boy!
Oh, what shall I do? I am in dire trouble. I love
him, monsieur.’ ‘But you did not come,’ I said. ‘I
could not,’ she replied, and she was weeping. ‘I
live with an aunt; a rich tiger she is, monsieur, and
she wants me to marry a count, a fat leering fellow
who smells of attar of roses and garlic. My aunt
locked me in my room. And now I have lost the one
I love, for he will think I have refused him, and he
is so proud he will never ask me again.’ ‘But surely
you could let him know?’ I suggested. ‘But I do
not know where he lives,’ she said. ‘And in a few
days my aunt is taking me off to Rome, where the
count is, and oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear——’ And
she wept on my shoulder, Napoleon, that poor little
American girl with the bright dark eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou began to brush the Napoleonic hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tried to comfort her,” he said. “I told her
that the young man would surely find her, that he
would come back and haunt the spot where they had
been happy, but I was telling her what I did not believe.
‘He may come tonight,’ I said, ‘or tomorrow.’
She waited until it was time to close the museum.
You saw her face as she left; did it not touch you
in the heart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou was downcast when he approached
Napoleon the next night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She waited again till closing time,” he said, “but
he did not come. It made me suffer to see her as
the hours went by and her hope ebbed away. At last
she had to leave, and at the door she said to me,
‘If you see him here again, please give him this.’
She handed me this card, Napoleon. See, it says,
‘I am at the Villa Rosina, Rome. I love you. Nina.’
Ah, the poor, poor young man. We must keep a
sharp watch for him, you and I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou and Napoleon did watch at the
Museum Pratoucy night after night. One, two, three,
four, five nights they watched for him. A week, a
month, more months passed, and he did not come.
There came instead one day news of so terrible a
nature that it left Papa Chibou ill and trembling.
The Museum Pratoucy was going to have to close its
doors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is no use,” said Monsieur Pratoucy, when he
dealt this blow to Papa Chibou. “I cannot go on.
Already I owe much, and my creditors are clamoring.
People will no longer pay a franc to see a
few old dummies when they can see an army of
red Indians, Arabs, brigands and dukes in the moving
pictures. Monday the Museum Pratoucy closes
its doors forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Monsieur Pratoucy,” exclaimed Papa
Chibou, aghast, “what about the people here? What
will become of Marie Antoinette, and the martyrs
and Napoleon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said the proprietor, “I’ll be able to realize
a little on them perhaps. On Tuesday they will
be sold at auction. Someone may buy them to melt
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To melt up, monsieur?” Papa Chibou faltered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But certainly. What else are they good for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely monsieur will want to keep them; a
few of them anyhow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep them? Aunt of the devil, but that is a droll
idea! Why should anyone want to keep shabby old
wax dummies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought,” murmured Papa Chibou, “that you
might keep just one—Napoleon, for example—as a
remembrance——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle of Satan, but you have odd notions! To
keep a souvenir of one’s bankruptcy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou went away to his little hole in the
wall. He sat on his cot and fingered his mustache
for an hour; the news had left him dizzy, had made
a cold vacuum under his belt buckle. From under
his cot, at last, he took a wooden box, unlocked three
separate locks and extracted a sock. From the sock
he took his fortune, his hoard of big copper ten-centime
pieces, tips he had saved for years. He
counted them over five times most carefully; but
no matter how he counted them he could not make
the total come to more than two hundred and twenty-one
francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night he did not tell Napoleon the news. He
did not tell any of them. Indeed he acted even more
cheerful than usual as he went from one figure to
another. He complimented Madame Lablanche, the
lady of the poisoned spouses, on how well she was
looking. He even had a kindly word to say to the lion
that was eating the two martyrs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all, Monsieur Lion,” he said, “I suppose it
is as proper for you to eat martyrs as it is for me to
eat bananas. Probably bananas do not enjoy being
eaten any more than martyrs do. In the past I have
said harsh things to you, Monsieur Lion; I am sorry I
said them, now. After all, it is hardly your fault
that you eat people. You were born with an appetite
for martyrs, just as I was born poor.” And he gently
tweaked the lion’s papier-mâché ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he came to Napoleon, Papa Chibou brushed
him with unusual care and thoroughness. With a
moistened cloth he polished the imperial nose, and he
took pains to be gentle with the cauliflower ear. He
told Napoleon the latest joke he had heard at the cabmen’s
café where he ate his breakfast of onion soup,
and, as the joke was mildly improper, nudged Napoleon
in the ribs, and winked at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are men of the world, eh, old friend?” said
Papa Chibou. “We are philosophers, is that not so?”
Then he added, “We take what life sends us, and
sometimes it sends hardnesses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wanted to talk more with Napoleon, but somehow
he couldn’t; abruptly, in the midst of a joke,
Papa Chibou broke off and hurried down into the
depths of the Chamber of Horrors and stood there
for a very long time staring at an unfortunate native
of Siam being trodden on by an elephant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until the morning of the auction sale
that Papa Chibou told Napoleon. Then, while the
crowd was gathering, he slipped up to Napoleon in
his corner and laid his hand on Napoleon’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the hardnesses of life has come to us, old
friend,” he said. “They are going to try to take you
away. But, courage! Papa Chibou does not desert
his friends. Listen!” And Papa Chibou patted his
pocket, which gave forth a jingling sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bidding began. Close to the auctioneer’s desk
stood a man, a wizened, rodent-eyed man with a
diamond ring and dirty fingers. Papa Chibou’s
heart went down like an express elevator when he
saw him, for he knew that the rodent-eyed man was
Mogen, the junk king of Paris. The auctioneer, in
a voice slightly encumbered by adenoids, began to
sell the various items in a hurried, perfunctory
manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Item 3 is Julius Cæsar, toga and sandals thrown
in. How much am I offered? One hundred and fifty
francs? Dirt cheap for a Roman emperor, that is.
Who’ll make it two hundred? Thank you, Monsieur
Mogen. The noblest Roman of them all is going at
two hundred francs. Are you all through at two hundred?
Going, going, gone! Julius Cæsar is sold to
Monsieur Mogen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou patted Cæsar’s back sympathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are worth more, my good Julius,” he said in
a whisper. “Goodby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was encouraged. If a comparatively new Cæsar
brought only two hundred, surely an old Napoleon
would bring no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sale progressed rapidly. Monsieur Mogen
bought the entire Chamber of Horrors. He bought
Marie Antoinette, and the martyrs and lions. Papa
Chibou, standing near Napoleon, withstood the strain
of waiting by chewing his mustache.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sale was very nearly over and Monsieur Mogen
had bought every item, when, with a yawn, the auctioneer
droned: “Now, ladies and gentlemen, we
come to Item 573, a collection of odds and ends,
mostly damaged goods, to be sold in one lot. The lot
includes one stuffed owl that seems to have molted
a bit; one Spanish shawl, torn; the head of an Apache
who has been guillotined, body missing; a small wax
camel, no humps; and an old wax figure of Napoleon,
with one ear damaged. What am I offered for the
lot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou’s heart stood still. He laid a reassuring
hand on Napoleon’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fool,” he whispered in Napoleon’s good ear,
“to put you in the same class as a camel, no humps,
and an owl. But never mind. It is lucky for us,
perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much for this assortment?” asked the auctioneer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One hundred francs,” said Mogen, the junk king.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One hundred and fifty,” said Papa Chibou, trying
to be calm. He had never spent so vast a sum all at
once in his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mogen fingered the material in Napoleon’s coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two hundred,” said the junk king.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you all through at two hundred?” queried
the auctioneer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two hundred and twenty-one,” called Papa Chibou.
His voice was a husky squeak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mogen from his rodent eyes glared at Papa Chibou
with annoyance and contempt. He raised his dirtiest
finger—the one with the diamond ring on it—toward
the auctioneer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Mogen bids two hundred and twenty-five,”
droned the auctioneer. “Do I hear two hundred
and fifty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou hated the world. The auctioneer
cast a look in his direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two hundred and twenty-five is bid,” the auctioneer
repeated. “Are you all through at two hundred
and twenty-five? Going, going—sold to Monsieur
Mogen for two hundred and twenty-five francs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stunned, Papa Chibou heard Mogen say casually,
“I’ll send round my carts for this stuff in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This stuff!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dully and with an aching breast Papa Chibou went
to his room down by the Roman arena. He packed his
few clothes into a box. Last of all he slowly took
from his cap the brass badge he had worn for so
many years; it bore the words “Chief Watchman.”
He had been proud of that title, even if it was slightly
inaccurate; he had been not only the chief but the
only watchman. Now he was nothing. It was hours
before he summoned up the energy to take his box
round to the room he had rented high up under the
roof of a tenement in a near-by alley. He knew he
should start to look for another job at once, but he
could not force himself to do so that day. Instead, he
stole back to the deserted museum and sat down on a
bench by the side of Napoleon. Silently he sat there
all night; but he did not sleep; he was thinking, and
the thought that kept pecking at his brain was to him a
shocking one. At last, as day began to edge its pale
way through the dusty windows of the museum, Papa
Chibou stood up with the air of a man who has been
through a mental struggle and has made up his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Napoleon,” he said, “we have been friends for a
quarter of a century and now we are to be separated
because a stranger had four francs more than I had.
That may be lawful, my old friend, but it is not
justice. You and I, we are not going to be parted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paris was not yet awake when Papa Chibou stole
with infinite caution into the narrow street beside
the museum. Along this street toward the tenement
where he had taken a room crept Papa Chibou. Sometimes
he had to pause for breath, for in his arms he
was carrying Napoleon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two policemen came to arrest Papa Chibou that
very afternoon. Mogen had missed Napoleon, and
he was a shrewd man. There was not the slightest
doubt of Papa Chibou’s guilt. There stood Napoleon
in the corner of his room, gazing pensively out over
the housetops. The police bundled the overwhelmed
and confused Papa Chibou into the police patrol, and
with him, as damning evidence, Napoleon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his cell in the city prison Papa Chibou sat with
his spirit caved in. To him jails and judges and justice
were terrible and mysterious affairs. He wondered
if he would be guillotined; perhaps not, since
his long life had been one of blameless conduct; but
the least he could expect, he reasoned, was a long
sentence to hard labor on Devil’s Island, and guillotining
had certain advantages over that. Perhaps it
would be better to be guillotined, he told himself,
now that Napoleon was sure to be melted up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The keeper who brought him his meal of stew
was a pessimist of jocular tendencies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pretty pickle,” said the keeper; “and at your
age too. You must be a very wicked old man to go
about stealing dummies. What will be safe now?
One may expect to find the Eiffel Tower missing any
morning. Dummy stealing! What a career! We
have had a man in here who stole a trolley car, and
one who made off with the anchor of a steamship, and
even one who pilfered a hippopotamus from a zoo,
but never one who stole a dummy—and an old one-eared
dummy, at that! It is an affair extraordinary!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what did they do to the gentleman who stole
the hippopotamus?” inquired Papa Chibou tremulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The keeper scratched his head to indicate thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” he said, “that they boiled him alive.
Either that or they transported him for life to
Morocco; I don’t recall exactly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou’s brow grew damp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a trial most comical, I can assure you,”
went on the keeper. “The judges were Messieurs
Bertouf, Goblin and Perouse—very amusing fellows,
all three of them. They had fun with the prisoner;
how I laughed. Judge Bertouf said, in sentencing
him, ‘We must be severe with you, pilferer of hippopotamuses.
We must make of you an example.
This business of hippopotamus pilfering is getting all
too common in Paris.’ They are witty fellows, those
judges.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou grew a shade paler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Terrible Trio?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Terrible Trio,” replied the keeper cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will they be my judges?” asked Papa Chibou.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most assuredly,” promised the keeper and strolled
away humming happily and rattling his big keys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou knew then that there was no hope
for him. Even into the Museum Pratoucy the reputation
of those three judges had penetrated, and it was
a sinister reputation indeed. They were three ancient,
grim men who had fairly earned their title,
The Terrible Trio, by the severity of their sentences;
evildoers blanched at their names, and this was a
matter of pride to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly the keeper came back; he was grinning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have the devil’s own luck, old-timer,” he
said to Papa Chibou. “First you have to be tried by
The Terrible Trio, and then you get assigned to you
as lawyer none other than Monsieur Georges Dufayel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this Monsieur Dufayel, is he then not a
good lawyer?” questioned Papa Chibou miserably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The keeper snickered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has not won a case for months,” he answered,
as if it were the most amusing thing imaginable. “It
is really better than a circus to hear him muddling
up his client’s affairs in court. His mind is not on
the case at all. Heaven knows where it is. When
he rises to plead before the judges he has no fire, no
passion. He mumbles and stutters. It is a saying
about the courts that one is as good as convicted who
has the ill luck to draw Monsieur Georges Dufayel
as his advocate. Still, if one is too poor to pay for a
lawyer, one must take what he can get. That’s philosophy,
eh, old-timer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, wait till tomorrow,” said the keeper gaily.
“Then you’ll have a real reason to groan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely I can see this Monsieur Dufayel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what’s the use? You stole the dummy, didn’t
you? It will be there in court to appear against you.
How entertaining! Witness for the prosecution:
Monsieur Napoleon. You are plainly as guilty as
Cain, old-timer, and the judges will boil your cabbage
for you very quickly and neatly, I can promise you
that. Well, see you tomorrow. Sleep well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou did not sleep well. He did not sleep
at all, in fact, and when they marched him into the
inclosure where sat the other nondescript offenders
against the law he was shaken and utterly wretched.
He was overawed by the great court room and the
thick atmosphere of seriousness that hung over it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did pluck up enough courage to ask a guard,
“Where is my lawyer, Monsieur Dufayel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he’s late, as usual,” replied the guard. And
then, for he was a waggish fellow, he added, “If
you’re lucky he won’t come at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou sank down on the prisoner’s bench
and raised his eyes to the tribunal opposite. His very
marrow was chilled by the sight of The Terrible Trio.
The chief judge, Bertouf, was a vast puff of a man,
who swelled out of his judicial chair like a poisonous
fungus. His black robe was familiar with spilled
brandy, and his dirty judicial bib was askew. His
face was bibulous and brutal, and he had the wattles
of a turkey gobbler. Judge Goblin, on his right,
looked to have mummified; he was at least a hundred
years old and had wrinkled parchment skin and red-rimmed
eyes that glittered like the eyes of a cobra.
Judge Perouse was one vast jungle of tangled grizzled
whisker, from the midst of which projected a cockatoo’s
beak of a nose; he looked at Papa Chibou and
licked his lips with a long pink tongue. Papa Chibou
all but fainted; he felt no bigger than a bean, and
less important; as for his judges, they seemed enormous
monsters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first case was called, a young swaggering fellow
who had stolen an orange from a push-cart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Monsieur Thief,” rumbled Judge Bertouf with
a scowl, “you are jaunty now. Will you be so jaunty
a year from today when you are released from prison?
I rather think not. Next case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou’s heart pumped with difficulty. A
year for an orange—and he had stolen a man! His
eyes roved round the room and he saw two guards
carrying in something which they stood before the
judges. It was Napoleon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A guard tapped Papa Chibou on the shoulder.
“You’re next,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my lawyer, Monsieur Dufayel——” began
Papa Chibou.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re in hard luck,” said the guard, “for here he
comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou in a daze found himself in the prisoner’s
dock. He saw coming toward him a pale
young man. Papa Chibou recognized him at once.
It was the slender, erect young man of the museum.
He was not very erect now; he was listless. He did
not recognize Papa Chibou; he barely glanced at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You stole something,” said the young lawyer,
and his voice was toneless. “The stolen goods were
found in your room. I think we might better plead
guilty and get it over with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, monsieur,” said Papa Chibou, for he had
let go all his hold on hope. “But attend a moment. I
have something—a message for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou fumbled through his pockets and at
last found the card of the American girl with the
bright dark eyes. He handed it to Georges Dufayel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She left it with me to give to you,” said Papa
Chibou. “I was chief watchman at the Museum Pratoucy,
you know. She came there night after night,
to wait for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man gripped the sides of the card with
both hands; his face, his eyes, everything about him
seemed suddenly charged with new life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten thousand million devils!” he cried. “And I
doubted her! I owe you much, monsieur. I owe you
everything.” He wrung Papa Chibou’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judge Bertouf gave an impatient judicial grunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are ready to hear your case, Advocate Dufayel,”
said the judge, “if you have one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The court attendants sniggered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little moment, monsieur the judge,” said the
lawyer. He turned to Papa Chibou. “Quick,” he
shot out, “tell me about the crime you are charged
with. What did you steal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Him,” replied Papa Chibou, pointing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That dummy of Napoleon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur could not understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you must tell me!” said the lawyer urgently.
“I must make a plea for you. These savages will be
severe enough, in any event; but I may be able to do
something. Quick; why did you steal this Napoleon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was his friend,” said Papa Chibou. “The
museum failed. They were going to sell Napoleon
for junk, Monsieur Dufayel. He was my friend. I
could not desert him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of the young advocate had caught fire;
they were lit with a flash. He brought his fist down
on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he rose in his place and addressed the court.
His voice was low, vibrant and passionate; the judges,
in spite of themselves, leaned forward to listen to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May it please the honorable judges of this court
of France,” he began, “my client is guilty. Yes, I
repeat in a voice of thunder, for all France to hear,
for the enemies of France to hear, for the whole
wide world to hear, he is guilty. He did steal this
figure of Napoleon, the lawful property of another.
I do not deny it. This old man, Jerome Chibou, is
guilty, and I for one am proud of his guilt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judge Bertouf grunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If your client is guilty, Advocate Dufayel,” he
said, “that settles it. Despite your pride in his guilt,
which is a peculiar notion, I confess, I am going to
sentence him to——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But wait, your honor!” Dufayel’s voice was compelling.
“You must, you shall hear me! Before you
pass sentence on this old man, let me ask you a question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you a Frenchman, Judge Bertouf?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you love France?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur has not the effrontery to suggest otherwise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I was sure of it. That is why you will listen
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I repeat then: Jerome Chibou is guilty. In the
law’s eyes he is a criminal. But in the eyes of
France and those who love her his guilt is a glorious
guilt; his guilt is more honorable than innocence
itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three judges looked at one another blankly;
Papa Chibou regarded his lawyer with wide eyes;
Georges Dufayel spoke on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These are times of turmoil and change in our
country, messieurs the judges. Proud traditions
which were once the birthright of every Frenchman
have been allowed to decay. Enemies beset us within
and without. Youth grows careless of that honor
which is the soul of a nation. Youth forgets the priceless
heritage of the ages, the great names that once
brought glory to France in the past, when Frenchmen
were Frenchmen. There are some in France who
may have forgotten the respect due a nation’s great”—here
Advocate Dufayel looked very hard at the judges—“but
there are a few patriots left who have not forgotten.
And there sits one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This poor old man has deep within him a glowing
devotion to France. You may say that he is a simple
unlettered peasant. You may say that he is a thief.
But I say, and true Frenchmen will say with me, that
he is a patriot, messieurs the judges. He loves Napoleon.
He loves him for what he did for France.
He loves him because in Napoleon burned that spirit
which has made France great. There was a time,
messieurs the judges, when your fathers and mine
dared share that love for a great leader. Need I
remind you of the career of Napoleon? I know I
need not. Need I tell you of his victories? I know
I need not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless Advocate Dufayel did tell them of the
career of Napoleon. With a wealth of detail and
many gestures he traced the rise of Napoleon; he
lingered over his battles; for an hour and ten minutes
he spoke eloquently of Napoleon and his part in the
history of France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may have forgotten,” he concluded, “and
others may have forgotten, but this old man sitting
here a prisoner—he did not forget. When mercenary
scoundrels wanted to throw on the junk heap this
effigy of one of France’s greatest sons, who was it that
saved him? Was it you, messieurs the judges? Was
it I? Alas, no. It was a poor old man who loved
Napoleon more than he loved himself. Consider,
messieurs the judges; they were going to throw on
the junk heap Napoleon—France’s Napoleon—our
Napoleon. Who would save him? Then up rose this
man, this Jerome Chibou, whom you would brand as
a thief, and he cried aloud for France and for the
whole world to hear, ‘Stop! Desecraters of Napoleon,
stop! There still lives one Frenchman who loves the
memories of his native land; there is still one patriot
left. I, I, Jerome Chibou, will save Napoleon!’ And
he did save him, messieurs the judges.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Advocate Dufayel mopped his brow, and leveling
an accusing finger at The Terrible Trio he said, “You
may send Jerome Chibou to jail. But when you do,
remember this: You are sending to jail the spirit of
France. You may find Jerome Chibou guilty. But
when you do, remember this: You are condemning a
man for love of country, for love of France. Wherever
true hearts beat in French bosoms, messieurs the
judges, there will the crime of Jerome Chibou be
understood, and there will the name of Jerome Chibou
be honored. Put him in prison, messieurs the judges.
Load his poor, feeble, old body with chains. And
a nation will tear down the prison walls, break
his chains, and pay homage to the man who
loved Napoleon and France so much that he was
willing to sacrifice himself on the altar of patriotism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Advocate Dufayel sat down; Papa Chibou raised
his eyes to the judges’ bench. Judge Perouse was
ostentatiously blowing his beak of a nose. Judge
Goblin, who wore a Sedan ribbon in his buttonhole,
was sniffling into his inkwell. And Chief Judge Bertouf
was openly blubbering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerome Chibou, stand up.” It was Chief Judge
Bertouf who spoke, and his voice was thick with
emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papa Chibou, quaking, stood up. A hand like a
hand of pink bananas was thrust down at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerome Chibou,” said Chief Judge Bertouf, “I
find you guilty. Your crime is patriotism in the first
degree. I sentence you to freedom. Let me have the
honor of shaking the hand of a true Frenchman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I,” said Judge Goblin, thrusting out a hand
as dry as autumn leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I also,” said Judge Perouse, reaching out a
hairy hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, furthermore,” said Chief Judge Bertouf,
“you shall continue to protect the Napoleon you
saved. I subscribe a hundred francs to buy him for
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I,” said Judge Goblin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I also,” said Judge Perouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they left the court room, Advocate Dufayel,
Papa Chibou and Napoleon, Papa Chibou turned to
his lawyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can never repay monsieur,” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” said the lawyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And would Monsieur Dufayel mind telling me
again the last name of Napoleon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Bonaparte, of course. Surely you
knew——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, no, Monsieur Dufayel. I am a man the most
ignorant. I did not know that my friend had done
such great things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t? Then what in the name of heaven
did you think Napoleon was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sort of murderer,” said Papa Chibou humbly.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Out beyond the walls of Paris in a garden stands
the villa of Georges Dufayel, who has become, everyone
says, the most eloquent and successful young
lawyer in the Paris courts. He lives there with his
wife, who has bright dark eyes. To get to his house
one must pass a tiny gatehouse, where lives a small
old man with a prodigious walrus mustache. Visitors
who peer into the gatehouse as they pass sometimes
get a shock, for standing in one corner of its only
room they see another small man, in uniform and a
big hat. He never moves, but stands there by the
window all day, one hand in the bosom of his coat,
the other at his side, while his eyes look out over the
garden. He is waiting for Papa Chibou to come
home after his work among the asparagus beds to tell
him the jokes and the news of the day.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch2'>A REPUTATION</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>MOKE and talk filled the dining-room of the
Heterogeneous Club, one of those small, intimate
clubs of reasonably liberal professional men and
women one finds here and there in New York City.
Alone, in his accustomed corner, Saunders Rook
alternately sipped black coffee and fingered a wan
mustache. He was on the fringe of an animated
group, in it without being of it, and on this, as on
other evenings, was taking an inconspicuous, nodding
part in the conversation, sometimes going so far as to
say “Not really?” to which the speaker would reply
perfunctorily, “Yes, really,” and go on as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nobody knew much about Saunders Rook, and he
aroused little, if any, curiosity. It was assumed by
the other members, on what grounds no one could say,
that he was an artist of some kind; perhaps he wrote
music criticism for one of the more pallid of the
weeklies; maybe he contributed notes on birds to an
ornithological review; again, it might be that he was
an architect, specializing in designing ornamental
drinking-fountains; perhaps he gave lessons on the
flute. His pepper-and-salt suits, his silent neckties,
his manner gave no hint. Yet he was not an enigma;
he’d gladly have told all about himself had anyone
cared to ask him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The members must have seen Saunders Rook scores
of times before that fateful evening, but had you asked
any of them to describe him, the reply doubtless
would have been:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, Saunders Rook. I believe there is such
a fellow around the club. Let me see. No, I don’t
think he’s very tall or very short or very dark or very
light. In fact, I don’t believe he’s very anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How and when he had become a member of the
club no one knew, and presumably no one had ever
been concerned about knowing. Perhaps he was a
friend of a friend of a member now deceased. He
dined at the club four or five times a week and paid
his bills. No one remembered having seen his face
anywhere else. The Heterogeneous Club is proud of
the range and brilliance of its talk but until this
night it had never discussed Saunders Rook. After
this night it could talk of little else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saunders Rook was not a glum, sullen, aloof soul;
he was not unnoticed by choice; evening after evening
he was on the edge of the circle of talk, listening,
as politely attentive as a well-trained collie. He may
even have ventured on one or two occasions to come
out with something positive; but if he ever did so, it
made no impression on the members of the club,
and they were a not unimpressionable lot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this night, as he sat over his coffee, Saunders
Rook from time to time moistened his lips with his
tongue and cleared his throat as if he were making
ready to say something important, and then compressed
his lips as if he had decided that it was not
worth saying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth was that Saunders Rook was afflicted with
“cab-wit,” that he was one of those unfortunates who
think of the bright things they might have said only
while on their way home in a taxicab. He was oppressed
by the knowledge that if he did say anything,
it would probably be as colorless and unoriginal as
he suspected himself to be. He was oppressed mildly,
for he was mild in all things, by the certainty that he
could not compete with the witty Max Skye or the
sparkling Lucile Davega, who could always quote
something arresting from Krafft-Ebing. He did not
enjoy being ignored any more than any other man
does, and he had his full share of man’s natural desire
for a beam of the limelight. A craving for attention
had of late been growing more insistent
within him. His mind began to play with ideas,
which, he reasoned, if uttered in a loud enough voice,
might bring his hearers to their, and his, feet. He
wanted just for once to cause a stir. Just once, he
told himself, would appease him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the lull that always comes from time
to time when groups are talking, and Saunders Rook
found himself saying distinctly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the Fourth of July I shall commit suicide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just why he said that he did not know. It must
have been sheer inspiration. As a matter of fact, he
had never contemplated doing anything of the kind.
He had never demanded much of life; his existence
was not rigorous, but placid. He was a sub-editor
on a woman’s magazine—he conducted the etiquette
page—and this brought him twelve hundred dollars
a year. He had inherited an income of twelve hundred more.
He was able to live in modest comfort,
for he was an orphan and a bachelor; he had a season
ticket to the opera; his health was good. If he had
a cross, it was a light one: minor editors of minor
magazines usually rejected his minor essays, imitations
of Charles Lamb, hymning the joys of pipe-smoking
and pork-chops. So it startled him not a
little to hear himself announcing his imminent self-destruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it produced the desired effect with an electrical
suddenness. The lull became a hush; not only the
group at his own long table, but other groups had
heard, and the eyes of the entire room were directed
to the man with the wan mustache.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear fellow,” cried Max Skye, “you don’t
really mean that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saunders Rook curbed an exigent impulse to recant
on the spot, and replied firmly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do mean it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A woman member in a far corner called:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you mind repeating what you said? I’m
not sure I heard you correctly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saunders Rook cleared his throat and said again,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the Fourth of July I shall commit suicide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The members began to shift their chairs so that
they could more plainly see and hear him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?” asked Lucile Davega.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, why?” came from other members. Some
were a little excited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saunders Rook had not thought that far ahead, and
the question confused him. He wanted very much
to say, “Of course, I was only jesting.” No, he
couldn’t do that. What a dolt they’d think him!
Hastily, he ransacked his brain, cleared his throat
to gain time, and declared:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a protest against the state of civilization in
America.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again sheer inspiration. The state of civilization,
up to that moment, had never worried him. He
heard an interested ripple run round the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what do you consider the state of civilization
to be?” asked Max Skye, bending toward him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rotten,” said Saunders Rook, emphatically.
Now that he was in for it, there was no sense in half-way
expressions. “Rotten,” if not elegant, was
strong, he decided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard someone in a corner whisper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, who is that fellow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, his name is Book or Cook or something,”
was the whispered answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled. He hoped they would think it the quiet,
resolute smile of martyrdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Mr.—er—Rook,” said Lucile Davega, “have
you made all your plans?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here was another contingency for which he had
not prepared. He slowly cleared his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have,” he said gravely. Then, with a touch
of mystery, added, “And I haven’t.” He hoped they
would probe no further. But the Heterogeneous Club
is composed of inveterate probers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, won’t you tell us all about them?” As Lucile
Davega said this she clasped her hands. Mr. Rook
frowned ever so slightly. They acted as if he were
planning a trip to Bermuda. He’d have to show them
how deadly in earnest he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you insist,” he said, his mind groping wildly
for plans. Unanimously, they insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind you it must go no further than this room,”
he said. They all said that of course it wouldn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Saunders Rook, speaking very deliberately,
“of course, you see, since it is to be a
protest, it must have a certain amount of publicity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everyone nodded approvingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I thought,” he felt his way along, “that I should
do it in some rather public place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Central Park?” suggested Max Skye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly,” replied Saunders Rook, grasping at
the idea. “The very place I had in mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were murmurs of “Splendid!” “A big
thought!” “There’s a lot more to these quiet chaps
than meets the eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saunders Rook, hearing, glowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then Oscar Findlater made one of his infrequent
appearances at the club. The members were
proud of belonging to the same club as Oscar Findlater,
who was editor of “The Liberal Voice,” most
advanced and oracular of weeklies. He was a vastly
serious person of Jovian demeanor. Usually the
members flocked about him to catch the pronouncements
that dropped from his lips, but on this evening
they only nodded toward him and continued to gaze
expectantly at Saunders Rook. To Saunders Rook,
Oscar Findlater had always seemed a god, despite the
fact that “The Liberal Voice” had rejected numerous
choice essays on pipe-smoking by the fireplace and
kindred topics over which Saunders Rook had toiled.
He had mildly envied the attention paid to the editorial
Olympian. Now he, Saunders Rook, was
actually stealing the spotlight from the great man.
It was most pleasant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, Findlater,” said Max Skye. “You
know Saunders Rook, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The editor murmured something about never having
had that pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rook,” announced Max Skye, impressively, “is
going to commit suicide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the Fourth of July,” added Judy Atwater.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a protest,” contributed Rogers Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Against the rotten condition of civilization in
America,” finished Lucile Davega.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oscar Findlater gazed at the wan mustache with
sharpened interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not really?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Saunders Rook, in the voice of a man
whose mind is irrevocably made up, “really.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove!” cried Oscar Findlater, and sat down.
He was plainly stirred. “Do you mind talking to me
about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” said Saunders Rook, trying to inject
casualness into his tone, “if you think it at all interesting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Interesting?” Oscar Findlater excitedly stroked
the black ribbon that streamed from his nose-glasses.
“Why, man alive, it’s overpowering. Biggest idea
I’ve struck this year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He studied Saunders Rook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mind is made up?” the great man asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing can change it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Findlater, with a sigh, “then I suppose
we must make the best of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sank his head on his bosom, the usual attitude
by which his disciples knew he was submerged in
thought. Then he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rook, would you consider doing a series of essays
for ‘The Liberal Voice’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would he? What a question! Saunders Rook
could only nod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s say six essays tracing the genesis of the
idea, you know, and arraigning civilization.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Saunders Rook merely nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” went on Oscar Findlater, “there are
only three weeks between now—” he paused embarrassed—“and
then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saunders Rook murmured:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still,” exclaimed Oscar Findlater, struck by a
happy thought, “we could bring out the last three
posthumously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Posthumously,” echoed Saunders Rook, sepulchrally.
At that second came again the impulse to
say, “But, of course, this is all in fun.” He stifled it.
After all, it was something to have essays in “The Liberal
Voice,” even posthumously. “How long should
they be?” Saunders Rook found himself asking carelessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, about three thousand words; more if necessary.
Not too heavy in tone, of course, or morbid.
Readable, you know, almost chatty; but with an underlying
strain of philosophy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely,” said Saunders Rook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll want the first one immediately,” said the
editor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall have it,” promised Saunders Rook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not but note the admiration, almost awe,
in the circle of eyes. He was wise enough to depart
before the spell was broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, rising, “I think I’ll run along to
bed now. Can’t be too careful of my health, you
know.” He tossed this last sentence off with a grim
smile. He was full of inspiration tonight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The members crowded around him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come to my studio for tea tomorrow?”
asked Lucile Davega.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And dine with me afterward at the Authors’ Club,”
insisted Max Skye. “Some fellows I want you to
meet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d love to have you come up to Croton for a
week-end,” said Rogers Joyce. “The crowd up there
would like to know you. Jolly lot. Keen on new
ideas like yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time in his thirty-three years Saunders
Rook had the gratifying sensation of being inundated
with invitations, of being sought after. He consulted
a date-book, appeared surprised to find that it so
happened that he was not booked up to any extent in
the near future, and accepted sundry invitations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he strolled to his snug two rooms and bath in
Grove Street, Saunders Rook could not but congratulate
himself on being a singularly fortunate fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the tea given by Lucile Davega Saunders Rook
experienced a new and not unwelcome sensation: he
was lionized. He found it extremely pleasant to play
the lion to a studio of pretty women. He noted how
the tea went cold and the toast untasted as they flocked
around him. Also, each one found an opportunity to
take him aside and say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you don’t really mean it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do,” he would reply almost severely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what have you against civilization?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s rotten,” he would growl. He was getting
better and better in the rôle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Mr. Rook!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He enjoyed the sensation he was creating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One girl, Margery Storey, who was young and
had red hair, a combination that sometimes appeared
in Saunders Rook’s dreams and private yearnings,
whispered to him that she was sure he was disappointed
in love; but, she added archly, there were
plenty of uncaught fish in the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said sternly that love or lack of it did not enter
into his plan at all. The act he was to perform was
to be a perfectly calm, philosophic protest against
the state of civilization in America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will remember,” he told her, “how the
early Christians walked naked into the arenas as a
protest against the brutality of the gladiatorial combats.
My motive, I hope, is equally untinged by any
selfish emotion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His heart was accelerated by her glance, so full of
compassion. She said a little diffidently that she was
a painter, and would he sit for his portrait? She’d
love to do it; her studio was Number 148——</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, he interrupted, he could not. Actually he
wanted to very much. He was busy, he explained, on
a series of essays for “The Liberal Voice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After that, then?” she suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For me,” said Saunders Rook, “there will be no
‘after that.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her blue eyes were full of sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems too bad,” she said. “You are still so
young.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled a smile of practised cynicism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In years, perhaps,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw that he had moved her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Decidedly, this new rôle of his was worth playing,
said Saunders Rook to himself as he donned his
dinner-jacket that night in preparation for his dinner
with Max Skye at the Authors’ Club. He was pleased
with himself. In retrospect were the sympathetic blue
eyes of Margery Storey; in prospect, a dinner among
the celebrities of the Authors’ Club, into which
sacred premises he had never gone physically, but
solely in his most roseate imaginings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Max Skye, who was a poet of no mean repute, introduced
Saunders Rook to a group of notable men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This,” said Max Skye, with the air of a showman,
“is Mr. Saunders Rook, who is going to commit
suicide on the Fourth of July.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saunders Rook bowed to them; gravely they bowed
back and stared at him, fascinated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Central Park,” continued Max Skye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saunders Rook bowed deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a protest against the rotten state of our civilization,”
added Max Skye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saunders Rook again bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They returned his bows with marked deference, he
noted delightedly. He managed, however, to maintain
an air of great world-weariness as he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When one feels as I do about it, what else can one
do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had rehearsed this coming up in the taxicab.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Rook is writing a series of six essays for ‘The
Liberal Voice,’ ” announced Max Skye, plainly proud
to be the discoverer and friend of so remarkable a
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” objected Deline, the novelist, a man Saunders
Rook had long admired from afar, “how can
you publish six essays? It’s June now. When
could the last three be published?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Posthumously,” said Saunders Rook, with a
touch of pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Posthumously?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all repeated the word as if there was magic
in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why do you feel that the state of civilization
requires so drastic a protest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deline asked this question as Saunders Rook was
enjoying the third course, tender roast young guinea-fowl
with mushrooms; Rook loved good food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” said Saunders Rook, with fork poised,
“it’s rotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Around the table went murmurs of approbation
and interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear fellow,” exclaimed Deline, warmly
laying his hand on Saunders Rook’s arm, “we need
men like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” cried others about the table. “America
needs men with the courage of their convictions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” said Deline, with a wave of his hand.
“You’re needed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one had ever before intimated to Saunders
Rook that he was in the least needed. The happy
thought occurred to him to rise and say, “In that
case, gentlemen, I shall stay with you.” But he
didn’t say that. Going home in the taxicab, he wished
that he had. What he actually did was to sit with
folded arms, a picture of determination, and say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When one feels as I do about it, what else can
one do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps, after all, he mused, it was just as well that
he had not recanted. It was something to be told by
a great novelist that you are needed. Perhaps, if he
recanted, they might discover that they did not need
him so very much, after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days later as he sat at his desk among the
other sub-editors—beauty editors, household editors,
baby-care and feeding editors, kiddie page editors,
cooking editors—he was summoned, just as he’d
finished writing a letter to a lady in Waterloo, Iowa,
to tell her that engraved invitations are not required
for a straw-ride, into the sanctum and presence of
the publisher and owner of the magazine, Keable
Gowler, a man of terrifying importance in Saunders
Rook’s eyes. Until that moment it had not occurred
to Saunders Rook that he was anything more to Mr.
Gowler than a name on the pay-roll, and rather far
down on the pay-roll at that. Yet Mr. Gowler greeted
him with a fatherly affability, and offered him a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Rook, tell me all about it,” said Mr. Gowler,
with heavy geniality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About what, Mr. Gowler?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This story I’ve been hearing about you and the
Fourth of July.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really now——” began Saunders Rook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it true, or is it not true that you are going
to commit suicide in Madison Square?” demanded
Mr. Gowler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Central Park,” corrected Saunders Rook, mildly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Gowler made tutting noises with his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come now, Rook,” he said, “you’re not
serious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am,” said Saunders Rook. He was pleased to
know that he was more than a mere name to his employer,
and he wished to remain a personage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear young man,” cried Mr. Gowler,
distressed, “I ask you, would that be fair to the magazine?
People might hold us responsible, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can we be sure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have made it plain,” said Saunders Rook, “that
no petty, personal motives are behind my act. It is
to be purely a protest against the state of civilization
in America.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“America seems pretty civilized to me,” observed
Mr. Gowler. “What’s wrong with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s rotten,” said Saunders Rook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Gowler looked horrified, but he surveyed Mr.
Rook with a strong, new interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, now,” said Mr. Gowler, soothingly. “Let’s
see if we can’t settle this thing. We’d miss you,
Rook. The interior decoration page would miss
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do the etiquette page, Mr. Gowler,” said Saunders
Rook, gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes. I meant that; why, of course,” said
Mr. Gowler, hastily. He decapitated a cigar and
faced Saunders Rook. “Look here, Rook,” he said,
“I’m afraid we’ve been hiding your light under a
bushel around here. To be frank with you, I didn’t
realize the stuff you were made of—until a few days
ago.” Mr. Gowler paused significantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, what this magazine needs,” he went on, “is
a live young man of forceful character, who has modern
ideas and isn’t afraid to back them up. Roscoe
Quimper is getting old; been an editor too long; we
need a man with spirit for his position. Will you
take it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saunders Rook moistened dry lips; speech failed
him; it was a post he had long coveted. He affected
to consider.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It pays fifteen thousand,” said Mr. Gowler. His
tone was actually persuasive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saunders Rook thought swiftly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take charge, Mr. Gowler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” cried Mr. Gowler. “Good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until the Fourth of July,” added Saunders Rook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Gowler evinced his concern by a sharp elevation
of his shrubbery of eyebrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you are in earnest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course”—this was said almost cajolingly—“if
fifteen thousand seems too little, I might be willing
to——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saunders Rook held up his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” he said; “but it’s not a question of
money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Gowler shook his head dejectedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I guess there’s nothing I can say. Still”—he
brightened—“even if your mind is made up, you
could take charge until the Fourth of July and outline
a policy and get things started, couldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you wish,” said Saunders Rook, handsomely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” ejaculated Mr. Gowler. “Good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saunders Rook, somewhat in a daze, started for the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, by the way, Rook,” said Mr. Gowler, “couldn’t
you take dinner with us next Thursday? The
governor of the State, two United States senators,
a few congressmen, and a professor will be there.
They’d like to know you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saunders Rook riffled through his date-book and
said he might be late, as he had two teas and a talk
before a Brooklyn club scheduled for that day, but
that he would try to get to the dinner in time for the
dessert. Mr. Gowler was greatly obliged to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the dinner at Keable Gowler’s Fifth Avenue
house the attention paid to Saunders Rook by the
governor, the senators, the assorted congressmen, the
professor, and their wives would have flattered a
person even less susceptible than he. In trumpet
tones Mr. Gowler announced him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is Mr. Saunders Rook, one of my most
valued associates. On the Fourth of July, as a protest
against our civilization, he will commit suicide
in Washington Square.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Central Park,” said Saunders Rook, bowing
modestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not really?” they all said in breathless chorus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, really,” said Saunders Rook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He talked, and they listened. He had been expanding
the idea, and had worked up an indictment or two
against civilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over his after-dinner liqueur the governor declared
that, if necessary, he would do the only thing he
could think of to prevent Saunders Rook from robbing
the State of so valued a citizen, and that was call out
the militia. He was not prepared to say, he remarked
darkly, how he should employ it, for he was fresh
in the gubernatorial chair. However, he knew that a
governor has the power to call out the militia, and he
was interested to learn what would happen if he
did call it out. Surely the case of Saunders Rook, he
maintained, warranted the step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The senator from Alabama promised that he would
see the President at once, and volunteered to get the
cooperation of Federal troops to help the governor’s
militia. Saunders Rook listened, sphinx-like, outwardly
impassive, inwardly agog. The senator from
North Dakota said that it had not before been called
to his attention that the state of civilization in these
United States was sufficiently rotten to cause a man of
his good friend Rook’s high type to plan so violent
a protest, but now that it had been called to his
attention, something should be done about it by the
Senate. Political considerations, he said, prevented
him from committing himself to any definite program,
but this he would do: he would rush back to Washington
on the morrow and start a senatorial investigation
into civilization at which Saunders Rook would
be the chief witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the congressmen present said that for his
part he was prepared to introduce a resolution in the
House of Representatives calling for the immediate
appropriation of three hundred thousand dollars for
the establishing of a congressional commission of
seven on civilization, and that, obviously, the only
person for the chairmanship was Mr. Rook. Another
congressman said he was in hearty agreement with
his honorable colleague in principle, but would like to
amend the bill, so that it would call for eight hundred
thousand dollars and a commission of twenty-one.
While they were debating this point, Saunders Rook
forced himself to depart. He had to look over the
proofs of his article in “The Liberal Voice,” he said.
Keable Gowler himself helped Saunders Rook on with
his coat and urged him to come again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The appearance of the first Rook article brought
him a tidal wave of letters. Scores of persons in
all parts of the globe begged him for various reasons
not to do it; two elderly ladies offered to adopt him
and leave him their not inconsiderable estates; a
group of young Russian radicals by cable offered to
jump into the Volga on the Fourth of July to show
they were in sympathy with him; eleven clergymen
asked permission to call; a publishing house offered
him a handsome figure for his diary, novel, or what
had he? Fourteen ladies of different ages offered
to marry him, and of these seven sent photographs,
of which two were quite personable; three motion-picture
companies asked him to name his own price
for the exclusive rights; a vaudeville syndicate offered
him two thousand a week for a ten-minute monolog
twice daily until the Fourth of July; the police commissioner
wrote to warn him that suicide is an offense
amounting to disorderly conduct, and is punishable
by fine or imprisonment, or both. A procession of
reporters, photographers, feature-story writers, and
interviewers invaded his apartment. In newspapers
and magazines his wan features began to appear, accompanied
by stories of varying degrees of accuracy.
He began to be pointed out on the street; ribs were
nudged as he passed. He loved it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crowded days passed, days full of pleasurable
excitement and intense living for Saunders Rook. So
swiftly did they speed by that it was a distinct shock
for him, one morning, to be awakened by a boy with
a tall stack of telegrams. The messages were from
many people and many places; some urged, begged,
and a few even conjured him not to do it today; many
said simply, “Farewell.” Today? Saunders Rook
glanced at the date on the telegrams—“July Fourth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dressed himself with care in his new gray suit
and lavender tie, took his bamboo stick, and sauntered
up Fifth Avenue. It was a delicious, sun-lit day; the
avenue was bright with flags; somewhere a parade
was forming, and he heard the gay sounds of distant
bands. Life had never seemed quite so fair to Saunders
Rook, but, and he stopped abruptly, what of
tomorrow?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Today, the Fourth of July, the eyes of the nation
were on him. He bought a morning paper. Yes,
there he was on the front page, a picture, smudged,
but resolute-looking, and a two-column headline,
“Saunders, Self-Slain Today for Civilization’s Sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wiped his brow with his silk handkerchief. It
was impossible for him not to think of himself on
July fifth; also July sixth, seventh, eighth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a lot of dynamite there is in one little
word!” he muttered to himself. “What a difference
there is between, ‘Saunders Rook, the man who is
going to commit suicide on the Fourth of July,’ and
‘Saunders Rook, the man who <span class='it'>was</span> going to commit
suicide on the Fourth of July!’ One is romantic,
promising, glorious; the other,—ugh!—the other is
the epitaph of a weakling, a turncoat, a failure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped before a picture-store and moodily
gazed at a seascape in the window. He recalled that
some sage has said, “Any man can make a reputation;
it takes a real man to keep one.” He had a reputation,
he reflected. He derived pleasure from that
fact even now. It was more than he had dared hope
for. Three weeks before it had seemed that he
had been cast for a minor rôle in life, the voice of the
mob offstage; almost overnight he had attained stardom.
He, who had never expected to have a line to
speak, had strutted and postured and declaimed in
the center of the stage and heard the sweet music of
applause. Today he was a hero; tomorrow he would
be a joke. The day was warm, but he shuddered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A holiday crowd in summer colors was passing.
There was laughter in the air. How intelligent the
people looked, he mused, and how civilized! A
graceful, powerful motor car purred by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused before a window full of books, and saw
many that interested him. He glanced up at the
spired heights of a church, and his gaze traveled onward
to a new building, towering, shapely, beautiful;
men, he reflected, had made it, had shaped the steel
and stone to their will. The paper dropped from his
fingers, and a passing stranger courteously picked it
up, and handed it to Saunders Rook with a friendly
smile. Saunders Rook felt an impulse to cry aloud,
“This land, these times aren’t so rotten, after all.”
The words died still-born. Down Fifty-second Street
he heard the shrill cry of a newsboy, “All about
Saunders Rook, the martyr.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hurried on toward Central Park. The governor
had kept his word; he had called out the militia; alert
soldiers with fixed bayonets patrolled the paths and
scrutinized the picnickers from under their hat-brims.
The green lawns were dotted with blue policemen.
They, too, were watchful. Indeed, as Saunders Rook
slipped into the park, unrecognized, he saw a burly
officer collar a mild, blond little man, and heard the
man protesting loudly that he was not Saunders Rook,
but only Ole Svenson, a pastry-cook, and that the
thing he had just eaten was not poison, but a banana.
As he left the man struggling in the hands of the law,
Saunders Rook shrugged his shoulders, smiled a pale
smile, and penetrated deeper into the park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve gone to a lot of trouble on my account,”
he said to himself, almost proudly. “It wasn’t always
like that. Funny how little interest people took in
me when I only wanted to live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked a flower and stuck it in his buttonhole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s great to have a reputation,” he remarked.
Then, as he paced along, added, “But it’s tough to
have to live up to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had reached the sequestered end of the reservoir,
and, glancing about, saw neither soldier nor
policeman in sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stupid, incompetent fools!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood looking down into the cool, clear water.
Then he raised his head and drew the fresh air into
his lungs, and expelled it with a sigh. How well he
felt! Slowly from an inside pocket he took his little
red date-book, and with his fountain-pen wrote in his
round, precise hand:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do this as a protest against the rotten state of
civilization. Saunders Rook.” He blotted it neatly
with a pocket blotter. He looked up at the smiling
sky and sighed deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, after all, a reputation is a reputation,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he jumped.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch3'>SON OF A SLOGANEER</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>M</span>R. BOWSER thumbed a buzzer. His secretary
popped into his office. All his staff popped
when Mr. Bowser buzzed. “Minktakmemo,” commanded
that high-powered executive. Translated this
meant, “Mink, take memo.” Mr. Bowser avoided the
use of useless words such as “a” and “the”; he had
calculated that they waste from twenty-one to twenty-seven
minutes of a busy man’s time per month. To
get into the habit of eliminating these words might
have proved difficult for an ordinary man, but not for
J. Sanford Bowser. He was not ordinary, and he was,
distinctly, a doer. There was a doing air about him
from hair tonic to rubber heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get-There Men have the Get-Things-Done Habit,”
he liked to say. As president of The Bowsers, Inc.,
publicity engineers, “Let The Bowsers Put You on
the Map!”—slogans leaped from his lips as naturally
as rabbits have children, and with even less effort.
He was passionately devoted to the science of slogan
making; to coin a striking trade name for a new can
opener, and couple with it some pregnant selling epigram—that,
to Mr. Bowser, was almost the apex of
human achievement. His mind, by long training,
plucked from the air pithy punch phrases—his own
expression—as swiftly and subconsciously as a man
tottering on the brink of a sneeze reaches for his
handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Minktakmemo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mink poised her silver-plated pencil—it was
a Bowser-advertised product—a Rite-Riter, “The
Pencil That Does Everything But Think”—over her
book. Mr. Bowser cleared his throat.</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Memo to Mrs. Bowser,” he dictated staccatoly,
“<span class='it'>in re</span> teething ring for baby. I have personally tried
all advertised brands of teething rings. My tests
show most scientific ring to be Cohnco Ring, Toy Efficient
for Teething Tots. (N. B. Pretty good slogan).
Cohnco Rings are (a) less rubbery in taste, (b) more
durable, and (c) fit well in the mouth. If you check
with me on Cohnco Rings I’ll order one gross sent to
our house at once.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(Signed) <span class='sc'>J. Sanford Bowser</span>, <span class='it'>President</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bowser lit a Marlborough-Somerset, “Each
Puff Has a Pedigree,” smoothed his straw colored
hair, and swooped down on a pile of mail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Minktakletter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mink prepared to take a letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Woonsocket Kumfee-Fit Undervest Co., Woonsocket,
R. I. Attention Mr. Snedecker——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, thus launched, Mr. Bowser whizzed through
his correspondence like a buzz saw through a ladyfinger,
ejecting punch-laden sentences even as a
machine gun ejects used cartridges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A person unfamiliar with the principles of high-speed
efficiency on which Mr. Bowser conducted his
life, business and domestic, might have thought that
Mrs. Bowser was in Fiji or Lapland or some equally
remote spot. As a matter of fact the surveyed distance
between Mr. Bowser and Mrs. Bowser at that precise
moment was twelve feet, for she occupied the office
next to his, and, as his partner and associate publicity
engineer, herself daily coined Slogans That Sell and
mothered Phrases That Put Products on the Map.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She would have been the first to reject with scorn
the suggestion that he should stick his head through
the doorway that connected their offices, and tell her,
verbally, about the teething rings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Secret of our Success,” she would have said—for
she, too, talked like a twenty-four-sheet poster—“is
Organization. Nothing is Too Small to be Organized.
In our country home, Caslon Farm, we have
a model kitchen and by motion study we have cut
down the motions our cook uses in making rice pudding
from forty-three to seven, or, with raisins, eight.
Organization! It used to take our nurse twenty-six
minutes by stop watch to bathe our baby; now she
does it in fourteen; we saved seven minutes just by using
blotters instead of towels. Yes, Henry T. Organization
is first vice-president of Success, Progress &amp; Co.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bowser’s memo <span class='it'>in re</span> teething rings reached
Mrs. Bowser’s desk within an hour. Mrs. Bowser—she
had been Pandora Irene Kunkle, of Dingman,
Tinney &amp; Kunkle, “Advertising in All Its Arteries,”
until a mutual devotion to slogans had brought her
and Mr. Bowser into partnership, commercial and
matrimonial—was a well-developed, copper-haired
woman, hovering around thirty-five. She had a sharp
chin and wore a stiff linen collar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gussing, take a memo,” she directed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gussing also wore a stiff collar and had a light
blond mustache, but at heart she was a woman. The
Bowsers always called the women of their company
by their last names; Mrs. Bowser was an ardent feminist
and felt that to call the female slogan makers
Ruth or Hattie or Olivia was too feminine, and to call
them Miss not in keeping with the spirit of camaraderie
which prevailed about the Bowser office except
during one short painful period each year when increases
in salaries were being discussed. Mrs. Bowser
stared thoughtfully from the window of the lofty
Bowser Building—“Built—like the Himalayas—for
the Ages,” and her gray-green eyes roved over the
kaleidoscope of New York’s roofs—red, green, brown,

<p class='pindent'>“Memo to Mr. Bowser,” she said, “<span class='it'>in re</span> teething

but our Mr. Hencastle reports that he is
soliciting the account of the Ess-Bee-Dee people who

to choose Kiddie-Kutter Rings for our son because of
the effect on the trade. I do not check with your suggestion

<p class='pindent'>Having discharged this wood-pulp arrow at her
spouse, Mrs. Bowser tapped her front teeth with her
pencil for three seconds; then, briskly: “Gussing, take
another memo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Bowser,” said Miss Gussing, who had a
bass voice. Mrs. Bowser herself insisted on this
method of address; it gave her a hearty man-to-man
feeling with Miss Gussing. With Mr. Bowser
the case was somewhat different; his male hired
help with salaries of more than five thousand dollars
a year called him J. S. B. as more intimate than
Mister and not so presumptuous as Sanford. Lesser
employees called him Chief, and still lesser ones
Mistered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Memo,” dictated Mrs. Bowser, “to Mr. Bowser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I incorporate it with the first one?” asked
Miss Gussing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bowser gave her a look fraught more with
pain than anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gussing,” she said, the sweetness of patience
struggling with the vinegar of reproof, “must I remind
you that the rule of The Bowsers, Inc., is:
One subject to one memo? Simplicity, Gussing, is
one of the First Flowers in the Garden of Organization.
M-m-m-m-m—not bad, that. Take that down,
Gussing. I may be able to use that phrase in the
Bedfello—the Hot Water Bottle Beautiful—campaign.
Now take a memo—a separate one if you
please, to Mr. Bowser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chastened Gussing suspended her pencil over
a virgin sheet.</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>In re</span> name for new cleaning powder,” said Mrs.
Bowser. “I have noted with care list of names for
new cleaning powder suggested by you. I do not
check with any of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘GARFINKLE’S Pride of the Bathroom’ has a
high-class appeal but is too long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘KLASSIC-KLEENER—Out, darned spot’—is
good and would permit a tie-up with Shakespere in
the ads, but the profanity might offend some possible
buyers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘TUB-PUP—Just Sic it on the Dirt’—is snappy
but hardly serious enough for a product that retails
at one dollar a can. Humor has no place in business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘ROSE-DUST—The Powder That Perfumes as it
Cleans’—is the best on your list because it suggests
quality and also Hammers Home” (caps, Gussing)
“the one distinctive point about the new powder—i.e.,
the fact that it has a pleasant smell. It is rather
more like fresh pine shavings than roses, I think.
In the name and slogan we must put across the
punch idea that this good-smelling powder is also
a cleaning agent with a kick. I attach list of names
I have developed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please let me have your reactions to these names

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bowser skimmed with agile eye her list
headed “Things To Get Done This Day,” then
dictated:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Memo to Mr. Bowser. <span class='it'>In re</span> christening baby.
Please note that baby will be one year old tomorrow.
He should be christened then. It is not intelligent
to continue to call him Baby and Junior indefinitely.
I suggest that you send me without delay list of
names you consider suitable for him. I will give
them my careful attention and I hope we can reach
an agreement today on this subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bowser tapped her teeth for two seconds,
glanced at her watch—a Krafty-Kronometer, “The
Personality Timepiece with the Different Tick” (her
own slogan)—and then became all animation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gussing,” she shot out, “get the Chicago and Salt
Lake City offices on the long distance, send Meldrum,
O’Grady and Kitchell to me at once, and order a
taxi to be here in fifteen minutes to take me to a
conference with Miss Switzer of the I-Say-Ma-Ma
Mechanical Doll Company at the Jill Club.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gussing bustled out and Mrs. Bowser tore into
her work like a tornado through a picnic of paper
dolls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mrs. Bowser returned from her luncheon
conference glowing with triumph over the fact that
she had sold Miss Switzer the idea of making some
of the dolls say “Pa-pa,” she found on her broad,
plate-glassed-topped, thoroughly organized desk two
memos on the bright orange paper Mr. Bowser used
so that memos emanating from the presidential office
might not be confused with the pallid blue and punchless
pink of lesser memoranda. She read them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>In re</span> slogan for new cleaning powder. I do not
like any names you have suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘LILY-LAVA—Makes Your Bathroom a Conservatory’
has possibilities, but my opinion is that many
housewives do not know what a conservatory is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bowser, as a fighting feminist, frowned at this
slight on the vocabulary of her sex, and read on:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘GARFINKO NOSTINKO—Easy on the Nostrils
but Hard on the Dirt’—is the best, but it just misses
hitting me hard enough. Somehow it lacks dignity;
I FEEL this lack. I shall concentrate on this problem
tonight after dinner and see if I can evolve a Clarion
Phrase That Will Shout Its Message from the Shelves.
I will let you know my final choice tomorrow.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bowser emitted a sound resembling “Humph.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His final choice!” she remarked, frowning at the
buzzer buttons on her desk, of which there were
enough to make a vest. “His final choice! As if
I personally did not sell Peabody Garfinkle the Bowsers’
Big Idea—Words That Hit Buyers in the Pocketbook!
As if I myself didn’t get his signature on a
three-hundred-thousand-dollar contract. Now Bowser
acts as if it were his product. Humph! Just like
a man. Garfinko Nostinko does not lack dignity.
Printed in orange-red on a deep purple background
it would Hit Any Housewife in the Buying Eye. I’m
going to fight for it. He is getting too bossy lately,
anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was in a decidedly truculent frame of mind
as she picked up the second orange memo from her
spouse:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“To Mrs. Bowser. <span class='it'>In re</span> christening baby. Have
given this matter much thought. Have decided that
the following points must be considered in choosing
name:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>A.</span> Our baby is no ordinary baby. An Unusual
Child should have an Unusual Name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>B.</span> Obviously, ordinary names, such as Robert,
Henry and Thomas, will not do; they are for ordinary
infants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C.</span> Our baby will be much in the public eye. As
the son of The Bowsers, Inc., he will receive much
publicity. Later when he is head of the company
his name will be a household word. His name must
be one that leaps out of a printed page and has strong
memory value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>D.</span> To get a really distinctive name for him we
must COIN ONE! We must use just as much scientific
care in coining it as if it were the name of a
product for which we were trying to create a National
Market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>E.</span> Therefore, in considering names for baby, ask
yourself these questions:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“1. Does it express baby’s personality?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“2. Is it distinctively individual?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“3. Is it easy to spell?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“4. Is it easy to say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“5. Is it easy to get over the telephone?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“6. Does it look well in type? (N. B. Have all
names set up in 12-point Caslon, new style.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“7. Has it a flowing, harmonious sound?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“8. Does it begin with some incisive, unusual, INTEREST-GRABBING
letter, like K, U, Y, V or Z?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“9. Has it that Can’t-Be-Forgotten PUNCH that
makes it Bite into a Man’s Memory and STICK there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>F.</span> I attach list of names that answer these requirements.

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bowser, with frosty eye scrutinized the list,
then tossed it on her desk with unmistakable petulance.
She had read:</p>

<p class='pindent'>If it is possible for a lady, a sloganeer and a college
graduate, to snort, Mrs. Bowser, at that moment,
snorted. She pronged at one of the buzzer buttons
with an outraged finger. Miss Gussing shot in as if
from a pneumatic tube.</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Gussing, take a memo. To Mr. Bowser. <span class='it'>In re</span>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gussing vanished as if she had seen a
boojum, but reappeared again after a brief interval,
in her hand one of the sacred orange memos. Mrs.
Bowser examined it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Memo to Mrs. Bowser. <span class='it'>In re</span> christening baby.

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bowser’s eyes sparkled with determination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gussing, take a memo,” she said in a crossing-the-Rubicon
voice. “Memo to Mr. Bowser. <span class='it'>In re</span>

<p class='pindent'>“JOHN.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“(Signed) <span class='sc'>P. I. Bowser</span>, <span class='it'>Associate President</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gussing regarded her chief blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John?” queried Miss Gussing. “John what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing. Just ‘JOHN.’ All caps, Gussing,” said
Mrs. Bowser, and her protruded chin symbolized
a made-up mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She signed the memo so fiercely that she broke her
pen—a Bowser-sold Product—“The Last-a-Lifetime
Pen—Shakspere Would Have Used One.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” ordered Mrs. Bowser, “take this to Mr.
Bowser at once and see that it is called to his attention.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gussing bounded from the room on her rubber
heels—they were “Spine-Pals—Your Backbone’s
Best Buddy.” Soon she bounded back. She carried
reverently an orange memo which she placed on the
desk. Mrs. Bowser plucked it up, read it, scowled.</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Memo to Mrs. Bowser. <span class='it'>In re</span> christening baby.
I cannot permit my son to be named John. Suggest
conference on this subject in Quiet Room at 4:40.
Do you check?</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(Signed) <span class='sc'>J. Sanford Bowser</span>, <span class='it'>President</span>.”</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Memo, Gussing.” Mrs. Bowser was almost feverish.
“To Mr. Bowser. <span class='it'>In re</span> christening baby. Must
remind you baby is my son as well as yours. I insist
on John. I will have conference with you in Quiet
Room at 4:40.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Quiet Room was a Bowser institution. It was
his idea, and he was proud of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Psychological!” he exclaimed. “I Believe in
Psychology. Do you know”—here he lowered his
voice as one imparting a confidence—“Psychology
Plays a Big Part in Modern Business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He contrived to give the impression to some of
his clients that he, Mr. Bowser, had discovered psychology.
At no small expense he had installed a
laboratory as part of the Bowser establishment, and
to it he brought all prospective clients that they might
observe his two hired psychologists, grave men, peering
darkly into microscopes or chevying guinea pigs
through mazes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are endeavoring to determine,” Mr. Bowser
would explain, “the basic psychological reason why
New York ladies prefer pink underthings while Boston
ladies prefer them white. Ultimately, through
psychology, we will be able to Condition the Buying
Habits of the Consumer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Bowser is a deep fellow,” the clients would
say to one another. “He’s scientific. He gets right
down to the bottom of things.” And they would
hasten to inscribe their names on the dotted line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Quiet Room had been planned by the psychologists,
after a series of experiments that cost the lives
of uncounted guinea pigs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This,” said Mr. Bowser, in introducing the Quiet
Room to his staff, “is a Thinking Chamber. Here
you can bring your Big Problems and in the Thought-Compelling
Silence Think Through to a Sane Solution.
When your Thinker is Fagged, come in here.
Just put up a sign outside the door, ‘Someone is
Now Thinking in this Room. Quiet, please,’ and
no one, not even the president, will dare disturb you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” added Mr. Bowser, with a smile at
once playful and yet with its serious side, “I hope
that this will not be construed as a suggestion that
you come in here to take a nap. That,” he concluded,
“would be beneath contempt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Quiet Room idea had worked out well; three
pairs of copy writers—one male and one female to
the pair—had announced their engagements since its
introduction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Quiet Room was done in mouse gray—walls,
carpets, furniture, even the lights were all of that
inaudible hue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were no pictures to distract attention; just
a simple sign in gray letters, “Quiet, please. This
is a Room for Thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this room Mrs. Bowser repaired at 4:40 precisely.
Mr. Bowser, himself the epitome of punctuality,
was just opening the door as she reached it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good afternoon, Bowser,” he said pleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good afternoon, Bowser,” she returned. They
had agreed that in business hours they would be
strictly businesslike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No Sentiment Between Nine and Five,” he had
proposed as, on their honeymoon, they motored
through New England looking for billboard sites.
And she had agreed heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They hung up the “Quiet, please” sign outside and
sat in mouse-toned chairs at a mouse-toned table.
Mr. Bowser spread out a sheaf of memos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I brought the correspondence in this matter,” he
explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bowser,” said his wife, “I want to say right here
and now that I won’t stand for one of your coined
names for my baby. I want to christen him John.”
She glanced at a list. “Yubar,” she said disdainfully.
“Sounds like a varnish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It strikes me,” said Mr. Bowser with dignity,
“that Yubar is an especially distinctive name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, for a varnish,” flashed Mrs. Bowser. “But
our son is not a varnish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The masculine Bowser frowned, then spoke in a
low-pitched voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are getting excited, Bowser. You are raising
your voice. Permit me to remind you that this is
the Quiet Room, not the smoking room at the Jill
Club.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t use that tone to me, Bowser. I’ll raise my
voice if I please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But think of the employees!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m thinking of my son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son, if I may say so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your son!” Mrs. Bowser exclaimed. “You talk
as if you’d bought him from a jobber.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bowser! In the Quiet Room too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiet Room be hanged!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You amaze me. Frankly, this conference cannot
proceed while you are in this mood. We are here
to confer, not to shout.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. You agree to John?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Emphatically no. I will not agree to John,
I tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s shouting now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll shout if I please. I veto John.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you do, do you! What am I—a rubber
stamp?” Mrs. Bowser’s eyes were snapping. “Don’t
try that he-man business on me, Bowser. First you
try to legislate through your own slogan for the
cleaning powder, and now you are trying to give
my son a name like a patented stove polish. I
say John. John! John!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice was shrill and his was not exactly suppressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you realize,” he said, “that we are having our
first quarrel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess I have good reason to quarrel. I want
to name the baby John. My mind’s made up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Never. Not John.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you want to call him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bowser compressed his lips masterfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kinzo,” he said loudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kinzo?” she protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kinzo Bowser,” he repeated. “An almost perfect
name! Look,” he went on in his selling voice. “Just
say it over. Just roll the syllables over on your
tongue. Kinzo Bowser! Hasn’t that a smooth, lyric
quality? Kin-zo Bow-ser! Get it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He whipped from his pocket a large card on which
he had printed KINZO BOWSER.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look!” he cried triumphantly. “Hasn’t that name
Eye-Stabbing Power? See how that ‘K’ sticks out.
Notice how that final ‘O’ ends the word with a snap.
Why, that name fairly sings out loud. Kinzo Bowser!
I tell you it would stand out on a dealer’s shelf like
a wart on a bald head!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who wants our baby’s name to stand out on a
shelf?” Mrs. Bowser demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Mr. Bowser with some slight confusion.
“I meant in case he ever manufactured canned goods.
He might, you know. We owe it to him to pick a
name that would be useful under any and all circumstances,
don’t we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John!” was all Mrs. Bowser said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John?” Mr. Bowser’s voice had many elements
of a roar in it. “John? Plebeian! Common! One
instantly associates John with mediocrity, with nincompoopity.
Why, when I hear the name John it
always suggests a man who sleeps in his underwear
and thinks grapefruit is poisonous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your name is John,” his wife reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bowser flushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I to blame for that?” he inquired warmly.
“You notice I call myself J. Sanford. Besides, my
father was a farmer, not a publicity engineer. He
knew about alfalfa but not about the Psychology of
A Name With A Punch. I tell you I won’t even
consider John. I want Kinzo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah! Sounds like a Japanese acrobat or a cure
for flat feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fastened upon her an eye impatient and stern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Apparently you haven’t grasped the first principles
of Names that Mean Something. Well, I
won’t argue with you while you’re in this state. Let’s
discuss something else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John,” said Mrs. Bowser with set jaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s postpone that subject, please,” he said.
“Peabody Garfinkle just phoned me that he must start
printing labels for his cans tomorrow. He wants
the design and name by one o’clock. He’ll use any
one our organization works out. That’s Client Confidence,
eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope it is not misplaced,” said Mrs. Bowser,
her voice scented with a faint perfume of irony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bowser ignored this observation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry I couldn’t check on any of your slogans
for the cleaning powder,” he remarked with a great
show of amiability. “One of yours—Garfinko Nostinko—almost
made the grade, but not quite. Just
didn’t pull the trigger with me, somehow. Your
slogan is excellent—‘Easy on the Nostrils But Hard
on the Dirt!’ Very pretty, very pretty. Pithy too.
But—a little long, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Bowser, don’t you recall that our Doctor Butterfield
worked out in the laboratory that the Human
Eye Can Only Rivet on Seven Words at Once? Your
slogan has nine. If you could somehow boil it
down——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll boil nothing down. I like it as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bowser shrugged his well-tailored shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And fly in the face of psychology?” he asked
gently, but as one who is hurt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bowser bridled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t look at me as if I were a naughty child,
Bowser!” she ejaculated. “I’m not a green copy
writer that you’ve caught wearing an unadvertised
brand of rubber heels. I was a Successful Slogan
Builder before I ever met you, please remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come now, control yourself. At least let me
tell you about the Big Thought I just had before I
came in here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bowser tapped her teeth with her pencil. Mr.
Bowser jumped to his feet and when he spoke his
voice held chords of rapture and his eyes were
alight with the joy of creation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” he began. Then in his special slogan
voice he declaimed: “Smelly-Welly—dirt-devourer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bowser regarded him without enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not bad,” she admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not bad?” he cried. “Great Scott, woman, it’s
perfect! Smelly-Welly! Why, it’s an inspiration.
Came to me like a flash from the sky. Smelly-Welly!
Easy to say, easy to spell and chock-full of punch.
Look here, Bowser, just look here!” From an inside
pocket he took a strip of cardboard on which he
had hastily lettered in large black print:</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>SMELLY-WELLY</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>Dirt-devourer</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He held it aloft, eyes beaming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just picture that in orange on a dark blue background!
Smelly-Welly! A child can say it. Ah,
an idea! ‘A child can use it just as easily as a
child can say it.’ We’ll print that on every can.
Why, it would be a sin to retail Smelly-Welly at a
dollar a can. I bet we could get a dollar and a half
easy for a product with a name like that. Smelly-Welly!
There’s magic in it, I tell you. Isn’t it a
peach, Bowser?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like Garfinko Nostinko better,” she answered
doggedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bit his lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do you?” he said stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; Smelly-Welly lacks dignity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that so? Well, I tried it on Mink, Pffeffer,
Boley, Deyo, Hendricks and Shinners, and they were
all most enthusiastic about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They would be, the jellyfish,” said Mrs. Bowser
dryly. “If you suggest Cupid’s Caress as the name
for a tire pump they’d applaud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bowser was outraged by this suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re just in a stubborn streak, Bowser,” he
declared. “No use reasoning with you. I shall use
Smelly-Welly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It lacks dignity,” she retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Smelly-Welly,” said Mr. Bowser with concentrated
gravity, “is my choice, and I intend that it
shall be used.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see about that,” said Mrs. Bowser grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A light and timorous tap sounded on the door; the
frightened face of Miss Mink peeped through the
crack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, Mr. Bowser,” she said, “but your reducing
class at the Billboard A. C. starts at 5:30 and it’s
now 5:25. You told me to be sure you didn’t miss
it again. Your car is waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll come directly, Mink,” said Mr. Bowser. He
turned to his wife. “I shall stay at the club tonight,”
he informed her, then stalked out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said nothing; ominously she tapped her teeth.
There was a buzzer in the Quiet Room—a pale gray
buzzer with a wan buzz; this she pressed. Miss
Gussing flitted into the room.</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Gussing, take a memo. To cook. <span class='it'>In re</span> dinner
tonight. Mr. Bowser will not be present. Tomato
soup, roast chicken, little green beans, guava jelly,
raspberry mousse, eight sharp.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(Signed) <span class='sc'>P. I. Bowser</span>, <span class='it'>Associate President</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Morn came to the office of J. Sanford Bowser.
Up and down, up and down paced Mr. Bowser, heedless
of the fact that he might wear a path in the
genuine Cabistan rug. That he, most careful of
men, should thus imperil so costly a piece of his
own property was a sure sign to his employees that
he was in no mood to be trifled with. His brow,
generally bland, was creased with care and perplexity.
He lit Marlborough-Somerset after Marlborough-Somerset,
then tossed them, half-smoked, into the
copper ash tray. J. Sanford Bowser was in conference
with himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heads of departments tiptoed about with ashen
faces and tight-shut lips; now and then they paused
in the corridors to exchange a few tense, whispered
words. Copy writers in their coops wrote furiously
but silently with soft black pencils; now and then
they glanced apprehensively over their shoulders as if
they momentarily expected the grim reaper himself
to enter. Little girls down in the checking department
curbed their giggles and masticated their gum
with nervous molars; even the space salesmen on
the benches in the reception room sensed the fact
that the atmosphere was electric with suspense; in
muted voices they muttered their selling talk over to
themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“J. S. B. is making some big decision,” whispered
the head of the copy department to the head of the
media department.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Chief is making some big decision,” whispered
Copy Writer Deyo to Copy Writer Shinners
as they held hands in the Quiet Room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Bowser is makin’ some big decision,” whispered
Mickey the messenger to Sallie the checker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mrs. Bowser, where was she? Alone and
aloof in her own private concentrating room on the
roof of the building, she did not know of the spiritual
wrestling match that went on in Mr. Bowser’s soul.
She was busy; her chin jutted out resolutely; with
pieces of colored paper and with paint she frantically
designed car cards, posters, cartons, on which she
lettered vigorously “Garfinko Nostinko.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hit them in the Eye with Something Tangible,”
she explained to the faithful Gussing who stood guard
outside the door to prevent interruption. “Once
Bowser sees these, he’ll forget Smelly-Welly. Smelly-Welly
lacks dignity, don’t you think, Gussing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Bowser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the theater of war, where Mr. Bowser battled
with himself, came a news bulletin which leaped
from mouth to mouth:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“J. S. B. is going into the Quiet Room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Chief is going into the Quiet Room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Bowser is going into the Quiet Room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They saw him, hands clasped behind him, chin
resting on necktie, eyes oblivious to things mundane,
stride down the corridor and into the Quiet Room.
As noiselessly as if it were the cobweb door to ghostland
the gray door purred shut behind him. From
basement to roof in the vast Bowser Building breaths
were held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Quiet Room Mr. Bowser set up on racks four
cards, in groups of two. The first card bore the
words:</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>SMELLY-WELLY</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>Dirt-devourer</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The second card had inscribed on it:</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>GARFINKO-NOSTINKO</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>Easy on the Nostrils, But Hard on the Dirt</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The other two cards were smaller. One bore the
words:</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>KINZO BOWSER</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other had written on it:</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>JOHN BOWSER</p>

<p class='pindent'>J. Sanford Bowser leaned back in a gray easy-chair,
stretched out his long legs and studied for many
minutes the cards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abruptly he stood erect; dynamically his teeth
clicked. With quick hands he seized the Garfinko Nostinko
card and the John Bowser card and tore
them into small bits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thinking out loud,” he said—a favorite expression
of his—“I intend to be master in my own office
and in my own home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He jabbed a buzzer button. Two thousand employees
of The Bowsers, Inc., breathed again. They
knew that the big decision had been made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spurted Miss Mink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Minktakmemo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him in some alarm; he appeared
ruffled, almost agitated. It was contagious; her hand
trembled.</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Memo to Hencastle,” he jerked out. “<span class='it'>In re</span> name.
My final decision is SMELLY-WELLY—Dirt-devourer!
This name must be used no matter what objections
are raised; it will be up to you to see that
this is done. Please note that appointment is for
one sharp, as per verbal instructions given this morning.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(Signed) <span class='sc'>J. Sanford Bowser</span>, <span class='it'>President</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He signed it as if he were signing the Declaration
of Independence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Minktaknuthermemo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mink snapped to attention.</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“To Hendricks. <span class='it'>In re</span> matter discussed this morning.
My final choice is Kinzo. Please carry out
my instructions to the letter. Use my limousine.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(Signed) <span class='sc'>J. Sanford Bowser</span>, <span class='it'>President</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” he directed, “when Hencastle and Hendricks
have left the office please find Mrs. Bowser
and ask her to be so good as to come to the Quiet
Room as soon as she can for a very important conference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mink scurried forth, and he picked up a large
pad of paper and began to sketch out posters for
the forthcoming Smelly-Welly campaign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So engrossed was he in this work that he did not
notice that it was fully two hours before Mrs. Bowser
entered. She was slightly disheveled, slightly
smeared with purple ink, slightly flushed, and in her
hand were many papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Bowser?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, please,” he said most affably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bowser,” he began levelly, “I’m not going to beat
around the bush. I’m going to tell you straight out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes narrowed suspiciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two heads,” stated Mr. Bowser, “may be better
than one in thinking, but one is better than two in
doing. So I determined today that I would go ahead
and name the new cleaning powder and attend to the
christening of the baby myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, have you really?” said Mrs. Bowser in a
voice ten degrees below freezing. “Important, if
true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true,” he rejoined calmly. “The things
have been done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Done? Done!” The first “done” she uttered was
a whisper; the second “done” a scream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely. Both jobs I put through according to
a careful plan,” he continued with serenity. “By
my order Hencastle went to Peabody Garfinkle and
told him he could order one million cans bearing
the label Smelly-Welly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bowser, incapable of speech, sucked in her
breath sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” finished Mr. Bowser, “also by my order,
Hendricks called at the house today, took the baby
to the church in the limousine, and had him christened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” asked Mrs. Bowser faintly. “John?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Mr. Bowser; “Kinzo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a brief second Mrs. Bowser appeared to be
about to swoon, but she didn’t; she spoke, but with an
effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are times,” she said slowly, “when mere
words cannot express thoughts. And this is one of
them.” Then, with mounting ire: “Do you mean to
sit there and tell me, J. Sanford Bowser, that you
had the unmitigated nerve to name my baby without——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, for heaven’s sake! There’s somebody at
the door,” he said. There was indeed somebody at
the door; the Bowsers heard a crackling noise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look! What’s that?” exclaimed Mr. Bowser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a newspaper; someone is poking it under
the door,” she said, mystified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stooped and picked up the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Early edition of the Evening Clarion,” he said.
“Look—it’s marked—right here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment they bent their heads over the sheet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mrs. Bowser gave forth a heartrending scream
that made the gray walls of the Quiet Room tremble;
then Mr. Bowser cried aloud “Great Cæsar’s ghost!”
and collapsed into a chair. Staring out in cold
black type they saw:</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Bowser Scion Christened</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The infant son of Mr. and Mrs. J. Sanford Bowser, well-known
publicity engineers, of Park Avenue, and Great Neck,
L. I., was christened at noon today in the Church of Saint
Jude the Obscure, by the Rev. James Russell Swiggette.
The name given the infant was Smelly-Welly Dirt-devourer
Bowser.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bowser recovered just enough to moan, “Great
Cæsar’s ghost—they got the memos mixed! They
got the memos mixed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Smelly-Welly Bowser,” repeated Mrs. Bowser
over and over, as if under some horrible spell.
“Smelly-Welly Bowser. My baby! Smelly-Welly
Bowser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They got the memos mixed, Pandora,” he said
abjectly. “I tell you they got the memos mixed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Smelly-Welly Bowser,” she moaned. “You
wanted an unusual name! You wanted a name no
one will forget! You wanted a name easy to say!
Well, you’ve got it! Oh, dear; oh, dear—Smelly-Welly
Bowser! My son. Smelly-Welly——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Pandora,” he cried, taking her hand, “how
can you—or he—ever forgive me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up and the beginning of a smile
twitched her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we’ll just have to call him John,” she said.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch4'>THE WRONGING OF EDWIN DELL</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>“O</span>NE, two, three, four,” counted Aunt Charity
as she put the hard-boiled eggs into the shoebox
beside the bananas, and twisted a little cornucopia
from the sheep-dip advertisement in the Crosby Corners’
News to hold the pepper and salt. “Do you
think four will be enough, Edwin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four what, Aunt Charity?” asked Edwin Dell,
looking up from his book; it was Jeremy Taylor’s
“Holy Living and Holy Dying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These,” she said, pointing a long, pale forefinger.
She never mentioned the word egg. To her there was
a suggestion of the improper about an egg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwin Dell looked at them, blushed, turned his
head away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so, Aunt Charity,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She cut slices of bread from the home-made loaf
and swaddled each slice in tissue paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be careful what victuals you eat in New
York, Edwin,” she said; it was half question, half
command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, Aunt Charity,” promised the young man.
“I’m always most particular about my victuals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit up straight, Edwin. And be sure to allow
plenty of time to get to the station. The New York
train leaves at three-twenty-four. What is it Emerson
says about punctuality?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Punctuality,” Edwin quoted, “is one of the legs
of the table of Success.” He knew his Emerson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Edwin——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Aunt Charity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t forget what I said about women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed I shan’t, aunt,” he said, earnestly. “I
shall eschew them. Indeed I shall eschew them,
Aunt Charity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better,” said his aunt, grimly. She was
a geometric woman, all angles, corners, tangents
and plane surfaces. The one man who might have
loved her was Euclid. She had come to Crosby
Corners, Connecticut, from Louisburg Square, Boston,
to bring up her infant nephew, Edwin Dell, an
orphan whose parents had been called away when
lightning struck the village church during Wednesday
prayer meeting. After Edwin was one year old she
always called the gardener in to give Edwin his
bath. She had conducted an exclusive school for
girls in Boston, and so was able to bring the child up
carefully and well. He had not been permitted to
go to school; that would have brought him in contact
with gauche persons. Any young man would have
envied him his ability to read Latin at sight and his
considerable knowledge of ecclesiastical history. The
malady of the time—ingrown worldliness—had never
tainted him. At twenty-one he had conversed with
practically no one but his aunt, and the Rev. Vernon
Stickney Entwistle, who came to tea on alternate
Tuesdays, and Palumbo, the Italian gardener, whose
remarks, by Aunt Charity’s strict orders were confined
to agricultural subjects, such as “Theesa punk”
and “Theesa cab.” It took Edwin some years to discover
that Palumbo was saying “This is a pumpkin”
and “This is a cabbage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Charity’s library consisted of the following
books: The Book of Common Prayer, Young’s Night
Thoughts, Fox’s Book of Martyrs, Holy Living and
Holy Dying, the Sermons of Bishop Amos Pratt, the
Sermons of the Rev. Hosea Ballou (in eleven volumes),
the Sermons of John Wesley Tweedy, D.D.,
the Collected Prayers of the Rev. Nathaniel Beasley,
the Sermons (one volume each) of the Revs. Snellgrove,
Tetter, Peabody, Kinsolving, Struthers, Kipp,
Manning, Pinkney, and Dodd, and The Genealogical
History of the Tillotson Family. Aunt Charity was
a Boston Tillotson. Young Edwin had free access to
this library, and, being by nature bookish, he read
all the volumes so assiduously that his aunt had
to renew the chintz slip-covers three distinct times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Edwin Dell was going to New York to
seek his fortune. It was his first visit to that great
city. In its libraries he planned to find material to
finish the work on which he was engaged, a scholarly
and exhaustive treatise on The History of the Dogma
of Infant Damnation in New England between 1800
and 1830. It was to fill six large volumes, possibly
ten. It would make something of a stir in the
more thoughtful literary circles, he expected, in all
modesty. He was a modest young man; he could not
tolerate mirrors in his bathroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His heart beat fast as he took his seat in the train
to New York. There he sat, waiting for the train
to start, his ticket and the address of his boarding
house clutched in one hand, his lunch box, with the
four hard-boiled blanks, clutched in the other. His
first week’s allowance was pinned to his union suit
by two safety pins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passengers, even hardened traveling salesmen,
turned to look twice at Edwin Dell; he was so young,
so fresh. His light blue eyes were large, round,
wondering; they looked at the world so candidly, so
trustingly. He had the tall, well-proportioned body
of the Tillotsons and the frank, boyish features of
the Dells. Not a million mud-baths could have given
him those cheeks, to which the color came easily;
they were Nature’s reward for clean living, early retiring,
and waking with the lark. Electricity had
had nothing to do with that wave in his blond hair;
that, too, was Nature’s gift. He was quietly dressed
in a pepper and salt suit; his necktie was blue with
white polka dots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edwin,” his aunt called through the window, “are
you sure you packed”—she looked about to be sure
no one overheard her—“your woolens?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Aunt Charity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the goose-grease?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Aunt Charity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you feel a cold coming on,” she said, “be
sure to rub the goose-grease on your——self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew she meant “chest”. He was glad she didn’t
say the word in front of all those strangers, but,
of course, he reflected, there was not the slightest
danger of Aunt Charity committing an indelicacy;
she tacitly admitted the existence of Edwin from chin
to ankles, but never mentioned it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edwin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, aunt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember what I said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About what, aunt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have no apprehension,” he said. “I shall eschew
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The engine tooted, the train creaked, and he was off
to New York.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>General Grant, it is likely, never stayed at the
boarding house of Miss Hetty Venable in West 13th
street. But the mark of his régime was on it, particularly
in its interior decorations. In Edwin Dell’s
room on the second floor, rear, hung heavy velvet portières
that still smelled faintly, from the campaign
cigar some roomer had smoked there during the
Hayes-Tilden election. The furniture was massive
and glum; the marble mantel was covered with a cloth
with yellow tassels; in the bathtub were painted
purple and green tulips of decalcomaniac tendencies;
the gas jets suffered from chronic asthma and halitosis.
The view from the window embraced four
back-yards as similar as pocket-dictionaries, with
frescoes of clothes-lines, and a liberal sprinkling of
ash-barrels, elderly shoes and used cats. Edwin
rubbed his hands with satisfaction; it seemed to him
an ideal place to write his kind of book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four days after Edwin Dell came to New York
and to West 13th Street, Miss Venable’s cook left to
accept a position in the moving pictures, and Edwin,
who had had his meals in his rooms till then, was
now forced to seek his nourishment outside. Was
it he who impersonated a serpent in a garden some
eons ago who led Edwin Dell to select for his meals
the Scarlet Hyena Tea Room, dinner eighty five cents,
with soup or salad, one dollar; chicken Sundays?
He thought he chose it because it lay on his route
to the Greenwich Village branch of the public library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was during his second dinner there that Edwin
Dell, looking up from page 512 of Bishop Groody’s
masterly defense of the theory of infant damnation,
saw the girl. He had been aware that there were
many girls in New York, but he had ignored them.
This girl was hard to ignore. She was looking at
him, looking directly and smiling a slight, shameless
smile. Edwin frowned, dropped his eyes to
his book, and felt uncomfortable. In his confusion
he salted his cocoa, and, on tasting it, sputtered.
He heard her only partly suppressed titter. He knew
that he was flushing. He tried to look up without
meeting her eye but he ran straight into her gaze;
she was smiling most provocatively. He gulped down
his cocoa, salt and all, and fled from the restaurant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How fresh and pure seemed the air of Seventh
Avenue as he crossed it! How reassuring the presence
of the traffic policeman! Edwin picked his way along
through the crisp December evening. The sound of
steps on the sidewalk behind him made him glance
over his shoulder. His heart fluttered. Somebody
was following him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the arc light he could see her unmistakable
dress, an unrestrained maroon batik affair besprint
with ochre fish pursuing mauve worms. It was she,
the one who had smiled. Edwin Dell’s backward
glance was hasty, but hasty as it was, it saw her smile,
and her wink. Something close akin to panic gripped
him and he lengthened his strides; from the <span class='it'>lap,
lap, lap</span> of her sandals he knew she too had increased
her pace. With anxious eyes he glanced at the numbers;
he had forty houses to go before he reached
Miss Venable’s. His breath began to come jerkily.
Thirty numbers more. She was gaining on him, and
was clearing her throat with a loud “Ahem” that
even to his inexperienced ears sounded manufactured.
Twenty more numbers; and the girl drew nearer,
nearer. Edwin broke into a species of canter; <span class='it'>lap,
lap, lap, lap</span>—she was cantering, too. Just in time he
reached the brown stone steps of Miss Venable’s
house; with two leaps he reached the door and miraculously
hit the key-hole the first stab. He slammed
the door shut behind him, and sank down, almost
fainting on the derby hats of the other roomers on
the hall hat-rack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day before Edwin Dell went forth, he stood
for a long time looking at a steel engraving he had
brought with him from his home in the country and
had tacked to the rose-dappled wall-paper. It was
a picture of Ralph Waldo Emerson. New courage
rushed into his system like air into a tire as he
gazed into the wise, kind, understanding eyes. He
ate a push-cart apple for breakfast and another for
lunch, and entrenched himself in the library behind
the bulwark of Bishop Groody’s ponderous tome.
It was past seven that evening when Edwin Dell had
intimations that he had a grosser side and must appease
it with food. He set forth to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwin Dell’s acquaintance with Freud was as
limited as Freud’s acquaintance with Edwin Dell.
Edwin Dell knew no more of the theory of the subconscious
than a trout does of trigonometry. Little
did the country lad realize that he was an iceberg
with one-third of him projecting above the surface
of consciousness, and the other two-thirds plunged
deep down in the murky realms of the subconscious.
So, with the utmost innocence of intention (ah, little
did he reck of the tricks of the subconscious!) he
found himself well into the fried atmosphere of the
Scarlet Hyena before he remembered that he had
resolved never to set foot in that place again. He
wheeled about to leave, but a vigilant waiter herded
him into a seat in a corner and affixed him there with
a napkin, a glass of water and butter. Edwin peered
round, and saw no cause for alarm. The girl was
not there. Her bobbed red head was nowhere visible
in the forest of black, brown, yellow and brindle
bobbed heads. With a relieved sigh he ordered
chicken liver omelet and weak tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was seeking for vestiges of chicken liver with
one eye and reading Groody’s epoch-making chapter,
“Have Babies Adult-sized Souls?” with the other,
when he became aware that someone had taken the
vacant seat across the table from him. Of course
he did not look up; he hadn’t the slightest interest
in knowing who it was. But the person addressed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon, but will you give me a light,”
the voice said. He had to look up then. It was she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wished to leave at once, but he was too well-bred,
so he said, with impersonal politeness:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, but I have no matches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” she laughed, “I’ll bet your aunt won’t let
you carry them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surprise made him exclaim:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My aunt? How do you know I have an aunt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl laughed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would,” was all she said. “Have a cigaret?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, I never smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” she said, and taking a box of matches from
her hand-bag she lit a long Russian cigaret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you did have matches all the time!” cried
Edwin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at the box in her hand, and said, as
if she were the most astonished person in the world:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, so I did.” Then she added, “My name is
Valerie Keat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwin had it drawn forcibly to his attention that
this woman was outrageously pretty in a bold, obvious
way. She had adventurous green eyes and an insinuating
mouth; her lips were a vivid carmine. Red,
thought Edwin, the sign of danger; a person to be
eschewed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a brief prayer that his tapioca pudding would
be brought soon, he took up his book and sought
safety in the prose of Bishop Groody. But the book
had changed to some foreign tongue; its pages seemed
blurred and its words hieroglyphics; had the Bishop
lapsed into Czech? His table companion laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you always read upside down?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his book right side up and looked at her
with what for Edwin was a glare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said he, stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re from the country?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. Why didn’t that wretch of a waiter
hurry with the pudding?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve just come to New York?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Edwin nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever been kissed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He straightened up in his chair as if a pin had
been abruptly inserted in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, now——” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call me Val,” she said. “What shall I call you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mind was too beside itself to be on the defensive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name,” he said, “is Edwin Tillotson Dell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll call you ‘Ned!’ ” she said. “I’m an artist.
How do you cheat the wolf, Ned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What field of endeavor do you decorate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me? Oh, I’m an—author.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How interesting your work must be!” Was she
sincere, or was she putting it all on? “What do
you author?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It occurred to him as an inspiration that he might
be able to swamp and daze her with technical theological
terms till his pudding came, so he began to quote
his book, beginning on page one. He did not, however,
get far.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can tell me all that when you come to see
me,” the girl interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I come to see you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. You’ll come, won’t you? Or shall I
come to see you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought of the eyes of Emerson—wise, kind,
understanding. His resolute teeth closed on a bit
of chicken liver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, he thought, should abash her, but it did nothing
of the sort. Instead, she gave him a playful
wink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned,” she said, “I used to belong to the Northwestern
Mounted Police and you know their motto.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get your man,” said Miss Keat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He buried embarrassed eyes in the tapioca pudding
which that moment providentially arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope,” he said, his eyes still on his plate, “that
nothing in my manner has encouraged you to venture
on such familiarity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was impossible to rebuff this woman with the
adventurous eyes and the carmine lips. Rebuffs rebounded
from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing this evening, Ned?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Intuitively he sensed his peril.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to my room,” he said, “to think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked up book, coat, hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not mad, Ned?” she called after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not mad,” he said, simply. “Only hurt,
terribly hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did go to his room as swiftly as if he had
been tapped for Skull and Bones. He locked the door.
He tried not to think of her, of those eyes, those
lips. He looked hard at the picture of Emerson, and
tried to think of him.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Valerie Keat lived in a reformed haymow over
a converted stable in a redeemed alley in Greenwich
Village. She had nineteen pairs of jade earrings,
black, georgette underwear, and the following
books: the Droll Tales, Jurgen, Mlle. de Maupin, The
Rainbow, the collected writings of Havelock Ellis,
the Decameron, the works of Rabelais, Ulysses, The
Genius, Many Marriages, The Memoirs of Casanova,
Sappho, Leaves of Grass, and an array of books in
French, beginning with Volupte by Sainte-Beuve and
Fleurs de Mal by Baudelaire and ending with La
Garconne by Victor Margueritte. She had divorced
one husband, had been divorced by a second, and
kept a little red leather note-book full of names and
telephone numbers. She was not a good girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her haymow studio was large, with several square
yards of north-light sky-light and a balcony from
which were draped bright Spanish shawls. On the
walls hung a dozen of her own paintings, most of
them guilty of grand or petty nudity. Her gold bed
stood on a platform reached by four purple steps
and it was snowed under by twenty-four fat, odd-shaped
cushions, each a different color, vermilion,
heliotrope, claret, taupe, wisteria, tan, orchid, bisque,
chrome yellow, bice, russet, carnation, cream, periwinkle,
cherry, azure, citrine, jet, bister, salmon,
maize, cinnabar, flame and flesh. She had invested
some of her alimony in Chinese screens, Japanese
prints, Russian brasses, Czecho-Slovakian china, East
Indian hand-printed curtains, French futuristic furniture,
a brocaded Bengal howdah to house her telephone,
tall, white, wicked-eyed Copenhagen porcelain
cats, Viennese statuettes, Florentine candle-sticks,
carved ivory cigarette boxes from Egypt, and a profusion
of thick, soft, Oriental rugs—Cabistans,
Hamadan Mosouls, Namazis-Kanepas, Zaronims, Dozar-Namazis,
Noborans, Ispahans, and a priceless
Anatolian prayer-rug. But this last she never used;
Valerie Keat was the sort of woman who never prays.
Soft lights with strange shades by Bakst, Urban and
Alice O’Neill filled the room with a sensuous glow.
In one corner a green bronze cobra made by Javanese
natives emitted subtle chypre incense from its eyes.
At the end of the room stood the model stand, covered
with black velvet. Beside it was a crimson baize
screen behind which the models undressed. Before the
fireplace lay a tiger-skin rug. Such was the place to
which Valerie Keat had sought to lure Edwin Dell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the very moment that night when Valerie Keat
in écru satin pajamas, sank down on her twenty-four
cushions, lit a Persian narghil, and opened a French
novel by Gyp, Edwin Dell, in his unpretentious white
muslin nightshirt, was lying on his plain iron cot;
was rereading a sentence from a letter he had just
received from his aunt. Half aloud he read the
words in Aunt Charity’s precise, virginal script:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people New York ennobles; others, it drags
straight down to H——.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>With his eyes resting on the picture of Emerson,
Edwin Dell said the word “Fortitude.” He repeated
the word—“Fortitude, fortitude, fortitude, fortitude,
fortitude,” until the gentle, dreamless sleep of innocence
wrapped him in its platonic embrace. Valerie
Keat dreamed of wild horses, rushing water,
satyrs.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For his frugal dinner next evening Edwin Dell
avoided the Scarlet Hyena and went instead to the
Esoteric Pussy-Cat, in a damp, artistic basement on
Washington Square, South. It was so full of young
men and older women eating the dollar dinner and
discussing intimate problems that only one seat was
left and that was in the window, where Edwin, perforce,
had to eat his dinner in the most distressingly
public fashion, while rude passers-by stopped to stare
at him, presumably under the impression that he was
advertising a dyspepsia cure. One passerby stopped
much longer than the rest and pressed a retroussé
nose against the window-pane. Edwin Dell’s heart
began to knock like a poor motor taking a high hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valerie Keat, for she it was, came bounding into the
restaurant and greeted him like an old friend. She
conjured up a chair and drew it to his table, uninvited.
He looked appealingly at the other diners,
seeking in all that throng one wise, kind, understanding
face. He sought in vain. The faces of New
Yorkers are hard, hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still damnationing the infants?” asked Valerie
Keat, breezily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Levity on that subject is most unbecoming,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unexpectedly her face grew sober under its film
of cosmetics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right, Edwin,” said Valerie Keat. “I
am too facetious. Perhaps you think I take nothing
in life seriously. But I do, I assure you I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, do you?” he said, hoping to convey the idea
that it didn’t in the least matter to him. Then, to his
surprise, he found himself adding the word “What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her green eyes bored into his light blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love,” she said, in a low, poignant voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwin beckoned the Japanese waiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My bill, please, at once,” he directed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vellygoo,” said the waiter, and brought it, discreetly
folded, as all restaurant bills are, as if they
were illicit billet doux. Edwin put his hand inside
his coat pocket. Alarm and dismay congealed him.
He had no money. Caring naught, as he did, for
worldly goods, he had entirely forgotten that he had
given away his allowance to the poor, and Aunt
Charity had forgotten to send him a fresh supply of
money. Doubtless she had sent it to the missionaries;
so much of her income went there. He looked up,
and there stood the waiter, suspicion in his oblique
Nipponese eyes. Valerie Keat was quick to sense the
situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Broke?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent over and from somewhere took a five
dollar bill, which she tossed to the waiter. He came
back with four dollars in change. Nonchalantly,
Valerie Keat waved the money away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep the change, Ito,” she said. The waiter
bowed himself back to the kitchen and fainted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I seldom tip more than two dollars,” the woman
explained, “but Ito has a wife and nine kiddies.
Don’t you just love kiddies, Ned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had he misjudged the woman, Edwin Dell wondered?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides,” went on Valerie Keat, and her voice
broke a little, “he reminds me of my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clouds seemed to lift from Edwin Dell. Surely
it was not possible to suspect the honorableness of the
intentions of a woman who spoke like that about
her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you stop at my studio?” he heard Valerie
Keat saying. “I want to give you a book I think
you should read.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only read books on ecclesiastical and theological
subjects,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what this book is,” she assured him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when they reached the door of her studio, something
(was it his guardian angel?) made Edwin hesitate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on up,” she said, urgently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s rather late,” objected Edwin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! It’s only nine. Come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mystery was in her smile; or was it mystery?</p>

<p class='pindent'>For one second, two seconds, possibly three seconds
he wavered. Then on the wall of the building
opposite he seemed to see written in fiery letters
the warning words of his aunt.</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>SOME PEOPLE NEW YORK ENNOBLES; OTHERS
IT DRAGS STRAIGHT DOWN TO H——.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>His soul was a battle-field of conflicting emotions.
What, he asked himself, would Emerson have done in
a case like this? That thought steadied him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said. “A thousand nevers. I’ll wait
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pain showed in the green eyes of Valerie Keat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you trust me?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust everyone,” said Edwin Dell, gently. “But
then I am so very young.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was your youth that attracted me,” she said;
then added hastily, “Don’t misunderstand me. I
am speaking purely in a professional sense. I am
an artist, you know. I want you for a model.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwin Dell shrank from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me?” he said. “A model?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, why not?” Her manner was most reassuring.
“I want to paint a Galahad or maybe a Parsifal.
You’d be perfect. I suppose you know”—here she
lowered her voice and her eyes were full of meaning—“that
you are very handsome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must not say such things to me,” said Edwin
Dell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me,” she murmured, “but I forgot myself.”
Then, very businesslike, “But you will pose
for me, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwin Dell drew back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been kind to me, Miss Keat,” he said,
“but please don’t ask this thing of me. Ask anything,
but not that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her tone was hurt as she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only want to help you. I know you’re hard up.
I pay some of my models ten dollars an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Remembering how she had spoken of her father,
Edwin felt that he had been a brute, and he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m very sorry. I don’t wish to seem ungrateful.
Perhaps it is foolish of me to care about .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. some
things; but I do. I think you’d better not stand out
here any longer; it’s beginning to snow; you’ll catch
your death of cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes lingered on his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you care?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said. “After all, you are a human
being.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought there was hardness in her laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” she said. “Then you won’t come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. Another time, perhaps. I’ll get that
book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She brought down to him a thick, much-thumbed
volume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure it is theological?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, indeed,” she said. “It’s by the Rev.
Mr. Rabelais. Well, bring it back when you’re finished
and I’ll lend you Leaves of Grass. Good
night, Ned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held out a small hand; he found it warm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember,” she said, pressing his hand, “about
my offer. Ten dollars an hour. I usually paint
at night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes were like emeralds held before lighted
candles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Venable met Edwin in the hall of his house.
She was a lady whose face appeared to have been
pickled, and she was pessimistic by nature and experience.
Her faith in human nature had been erased
by a life of running a rooming house; her roomers
were always using her gas to terminate their lives.
Briefly she informed Edwin that his rent was overdue.
She would trouble him, etc. Always the soul
of frankness, Edwin told her he had no money, but
that he would be in funds in a day or two. He even
tried to laugh a little to show her how unwarranted
her fears about his solvency were. Under her freezing
eyes and skeptic nose the laugh was hollow on
both ends and cracked in the middle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want ten dollars,” she said, “not promises. I
must have my money by midnight or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In pantomime she indicated an exit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Miss Venable, you can’t mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can’t I mean, young man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwin blanched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The streets,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One look at her stony countenance told him that
the streets were precisely what she did mean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stumbled up to his room, dropped into a chair,
and tried to collect his thoughts. In the rural calm
of his sheltered life he had never felt the raw edge
of existence before. This was stark life. He would
read a bit to compose his mind, he decided. He
opened the book Valerie Keat had given him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some words he knew, some he did not know, some
he suspected. A hot flush of shame began to mantle
his brow. At Chapter Four, he threw the book from
him. He dare not lift his eyes to Emerson’s. Hardly
knowing what he was doing, he marched down-stairs,
holding the book at arm’s length before him. One
idea was uppermost in his mind: he must take back
the book to its owner.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>He knocked with the gargoyle knocker, and Valerie
Keat came to her studio door in a Chinese mandarin
coat, thrown hurriedly about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” she said, “it’s Infant Damnation himself!
So you have come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “I have come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, step in. Don’t stand in the hall and wake
the neighbors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found himself inside the studio; the incense,
the mellow lights, the warmth, the magnificence of it
all left him incapable of speech. Then he remembered
why he had come and thrust the book out at
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could not sleep in the same house with this
thing,” he said. She shrugged her shoulders and
carelessly dropped the book on the tiger-skin rug.
A Swiss cuckoo clock proclaimed that it was ten.
Edwin shuddered; two hours to midnight .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
the streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let’s begin,” said Valerie Keat, picking up
a palette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Begin to what?” he asked, tremulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I to paint,” she answered; “you to pose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, merciful Heavens, Miss Keat, you don’t think
I came here for .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what did you come for?” Her eyes narrowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To bring back that dreadful book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her sardonic laugh jarred on his ear-drums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man doesn’t come to a woman’s studio late
at night to bring back a book,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must go, really I must,” declared Edwin, wondering,
as he spoke, where to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put his hand on the door-knob; the door seemed
to be locked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please reconsider your decision,” said Valerie
Keat. She turned on her most pathetic look. “If
I could paint you it would mean everything to me;
everything, do you understand? You have my artistic
career at your mercy. Won’t you help me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated. To one so good at heart as he,
such an appeal could not go unanswered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to,” he began, “but Emerson says——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides,” she broke in, “think of the ten dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had she read his inmost thoughts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What possible harm could it do?” she argued.
“Can’t you see I respect you? Won’t you trust me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me think,” begged Edwin Dell. “Give me
five minutes for quiet thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valerie Keat went to the buhlwork cabinet and took
out a square bottle and a glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” she said. “This will help you think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is only juniper-berry juice and water. It’s
a soft drink,” she told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes were so friendly, and he remembered how
she had spoken of her father, so he poured half a
glass of the pellucid drink down his dry throat. An
agreeable sensation of warmth and well-being filled
him. He emptied the glass. How bright the lights
were!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood up and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have arrived at a decision.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes? What?” she asked, eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be your model,” said Edwin Dell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sank back into his chair; there was a singing
in his ears, a dancing before his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead, paint me,” he said, almost with <span class='it'>sang
froid</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came close to him and fastened on him intense
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say you’ll be my model?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what that means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll pose for the head?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll pose for the shoulders?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gulped, but nodded. He felt his breath coming
in short, cold pants; his brow was icy damp. He
heard her low voice say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll pose for .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the figure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room swam before his eyes; his cheeks were
conflagrations; he drew in his breath with an effort,
and gulped again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever models do,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes ran over him like flies over a cake; beneath
them he trembled. How his heart throbbed!
In a nightmare, he heard her say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! Go behind that screen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Edwin Dell the lights were blurred now; the
singing in his ears was frenzied. His pallid face
was set. Walking like an automaton, he went behind
the crimson screen. Slowly his quivering fingers
fumbled with his polka-dot tie; his shoe lace seared
his finger-tips.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, get a wiggle on. Don’t take all night.
I’m waiting,” he heard the woman say. Her voice
sounded, somehow, tense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His teeth bit his bloodless lips; his nails dug into
the palms of his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fortitude,” whispered Edwin Dell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he stepped out on the tiger-skin rug.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Came morn to the bedroom of Edwin Dell. Dully
he opened his eyes. Had it all been a terrible dream?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went to the window and scooped up a handful
of snow and held it to his fevered brow. No, it
had not all been a terrible dream. He dressed with
leaden fingers. A letter had been slipped under his
door and he opened it without interest. What could
letters mean to him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a note from his aunt. She told him to come
home for Christmas, and enclosed a ticket to Crosby
Corners, and a check. The check fluttered to the
floor; the crooked smile of irony twisted his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too late,” he said “too late.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>More like a machine than a man, he began to pack
his straw suit-case. The last thing he did before
leaving the room was to take down the picture of
Emerson; Edwin did not look into those wise, kind,
understanding eyes; he tore the picture into small
pieces. Then, with bowed head, a wan, worn caricature
of what had been Edwin Dell went slowly out
into the snow-garbed metropolis.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was Christmas eve in Crosby Corners. Thick
snow was falling heavily and the wind whistled like
a drunken demon; it was cold, bitter cold. Edwin
Dell rapped with mittened hand on the door of the
cozy farm-house and Aunt Charity opened it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, aunt,” he said, “I’ve come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For pity’s sake, close the door,” she said. “Hang
up your coat and put your goloshes in the golosh-box.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did so. He sat there, silent, ashen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Edwin Dell, what ails you? What is the
matter?” she asked, sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing, nothing,” he faltered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why do you sigh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the wind,” he replied. “Only the wind
in the pines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiddlesticks! I know a sigh. Stop moping,
Edwin. This is Christmas eve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Christmas eve for some folks,” he said; “but
just night for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” his aunt asked, fixing on
him needle-pointed eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He poked the glowing logs and made no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edwin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, aunt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has anything happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He poked the logs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak to me, Edwin. Tell me all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He poked the logs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Charity put down her knitting, strode to him,
placed her hands on his shoulders and bent a face
lined with foreboding toward his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edwin Dell,” she questioned, hoarsely; “what
has New York done to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried to avoid her alarmed eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edwin Dell,” she cried, “I conjure you to answer
me one question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” His parched lips framed the word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, Edwin Dell, are you a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. good boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made no answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can’t be,” cried his aunt. “Look me in the
eye and I’ll know it isn’t so. Can you look me in
the eye, Edwin Dell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He couldn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pushed him fiercely from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God,” she screamed. “Not that, not that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Aunt Charity,” he groaned, “that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven give me strength in this dark hour,” she
prayed. “That this thing should happen—and you
a Tillotson. Tell me everything, I command you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was young,” was all he could say. “Nobody
told me; I didn’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faugh,” she sneered, towering above him, her
face working with wrath. “You might have guessed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she spoke so respectfully of her father,”
sobbed Edwin Dell. “It was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
the streets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His aunt scorched him with her outraged eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which would Emerson have chosen?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was drugged,” he wept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faugh! A likely story! Edwin Dell, put on
your goloshes and leave this house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He cowered in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tonight? In this blizzard?” he quavered.
“Where could I go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to her,” said his aunt, and held the front door
open.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Edwin Dell reached the studio of Valerie Keat late
Christmas night. Inside he could hear the sounds of
revelry—unrestrained laughter, bursts of song, a jazzing
phonograph, the bursting of toy balloons, the
popping of corks. Valerie Keat was holding high
carnival. His heart was no bigger than a pea as he
knocked. The door opened and a wave of hot air
laden with confetti, tobacco smoke, incense and the
fumes of alcohol rushed out and engulfed him. Inside
he saw a mad whirlpool of gala-dressed dancers.
Valerie Keat herself had opened the door; she stood
there in an artful evening gown of shimmering silver,
with no back whatsoever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” she snapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I. Edwin. Ned,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I see. What of it.” Her voice was icy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where shall I put my goloshes?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed down the stairs behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That way. One after another,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He staggered as if from a blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you can’t mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Auntie has turned me out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I. That makes it unanimous,” she said,
puffing mockingly her cigaret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it was because of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you,” he stammered.
“Have you forgotten .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve a poor memory,” she said unconcernedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you can’t mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Oh, think of your promises.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah,” said Valerie Keat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you no compassion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No honor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Valerie Keat, think of your father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flushed beneath her painted mask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You keep his name out of this,” she flashed.
“Run along now to your damnation infants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say this to me?” His voice was wild. “To
me? After my sacrifice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your sacrifice?” she jeered. “Do you tell all
the others that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reeled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The others?” he exclaimed aghast, “it’s a lie, a
shameful lie, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They all pull that one,” she gibed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All? All? Then there have been others, Valerie
Keat? Then I was naught but the plaything of an
idle hour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naught,” she replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you would fling me aside like a discarded
glove?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is just what I would fling you aside like,”
she answered, unmoved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see it all now,” said Edwin Dell, his voice
the voice of one utterly crushed. “The veil lifts from
my eyes. I’m just a man girls forget. You have
drained the cup of pleasure, but it is I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
who must pay .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fair enough,” said Valerie Keat, in a voice like
a file rasping steel. “Pay away. Good night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you would have me go .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. out of your life
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. forever?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or longer,” she said. “Shut the outside door
after you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did. The wind screamed down the alley;
whirling snow dervishes danced round him. Ten
thousand bright-lit windows bespoke the Christmas
cheer within. Some people were happy. But on the
once boyish face of Edwin Dell tiny hard pellets of
ice formed; they were frozen tears. On he wandered
through the night, he knew not whither. In time he
reached a large building, and tottered in; it was a railroad
station, a place where one bought tickets to go
away. To go away? His brain caught at the idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would go away. He went to the ticket window,
and put down all his money, twenty-four dollars and
seventy cents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me a ticket,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where to?” the ticket seller asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care,” said Edwin Dell. “Anywhere. I
want to go away .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. away from it all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. away
from this City of Broken Vows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man sold him a ticket to Granville, Ohio.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Pa! Oh, Pa!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Mary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a man lying in our wood-shed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fetch him in, daughter, fetch him in,” said Peter
Wood, known in Granville and for miles around as
“Big-hearted Peter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Mary Wood returned carrying the unconscious
form of Edwin Dell in her big strong arms.
She was a Greek goddess of a girl, with the brow of
Diana, the nose of Minerva, the chin of Venus and
the shoulders of Juno. Tenderly she laid Edwin
down beside the kitchen stove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be all right when he thaws out,” said the
farmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What lovely eyelashes he has,” said Mary Wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was bending over him with a steaming cup of
coffee when Edwin Dell slowly opened his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I in Heaven?” he asked, faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious sakes, no,” said Mary in her kind, contralto
voice. “What makes you think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you look like an angel,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Love was born in that minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Came spring to the world, and to Granville, and it
brought back the color to the cheeks of Edwin Dell.
He was strong enough to help Mary with the spring
cleaning. They talked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening, as the sun was sinking to rest in a
cloudy bed of strawberries and oranges, Mary said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edwin, let’s take a little walk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked together through the spring-scented
eventide; on the peach trees blossoms were burgeoning;
the vesper songs of mating birds could be heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s sit down with our backs to the silo,” suggested
Mary. They sat. She turned her great, gray,
honest eyes to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edwin,” she said, “folks are beginning to talk
about us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About us, Mary? What are they saying?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took a sudden interest in the toe of her shoe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you guess?” she said, softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “I can guess. But, oh, Mary, I’m
afraid that there are some dreams that can never come
true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand, Edwin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary, I must go away from here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From Granville? From .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. She searched his face with her ardent
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” she said, “you do not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. care?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you, Mary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laid her hand on his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tremendously,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, if it could only be,” he sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would June 14th at half past two be convenient
for you?” asked Mary. “They’ll have finished painting
the church by then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned grief-struck eyes to hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary,” he said, “it cannot be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Edwin, what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke as if each word he muttered were a stab.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a reason,” he said, “why we can never be
more than”—emotion nearly strangled him, but he
finished—“friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reason? What reason? Speak, Edwin, speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Simply this, Mary,” he answered, gravely. “I am
unworthy of your love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You unworthy, Edwin? No, no. You jest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never jest,” said Edwin Dell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edwin,” she cried, “I cannot endure this suspense.
Tell me, is there another?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hung his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was,” he said, “another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?” she said in an anguished
whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “I mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her grip on his hand tightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor boy,” said Mary Wood, “poor boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was young,” he said, brokenly, “and I was alone
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. alone in New York. Ah, New York, New York!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked up his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, “I guess I’d better be running
along now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop!” cried Mary Wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not know how it happened but they found
themselves in each other’s arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The past,” he heard Mary Wood saying, close to
his ear, “is past. The future lies ahead. I care not
what you have been, Edwin Dell. It is what you are
that I love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mary,” was all he could say. “Oh, Mary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True love,” she whispered, “conquers all.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>And so, together, hand in hand, like little children,
Edwin Dell and Mary Wood set out upon the shining
road toward the bright promise of a new world.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch5'>THE UNFAMILIAR</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>HO he was and what he was and where he
came from no one knew. How he came to
be in Crosby Corners was a mystery, and at harvesttime
Connecticut farmers are too busy to peer into
mysteries. He could not speak much English beyond
“Yes,” “No,” “Hungry,” and “Go Hell.” He could
gesture, however. He could gesture with his hands,
his elbows, his eyes, his feet. He appeared to be
trying by pantomime to convey the idea that he had
been forcibly seized in his native land, which was remote,
had been pressed into service aboard a ship, had
been very ill at sea, had escaped at a port, had fled on
a train, and had dropped, or been dropped, at Crosby
Corners. The farmers, however, had no time to interpret
pantomime. Farm-hands were scarce, and if a
man had two hands and at least one good eye, they
did not delve into his past or his pedigree; they put
him to work. It was thus that the small, scared man
in the velvet trousers entered the employ of Ben
Crosby, richest farmer in that region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I found the little rascal,” Ben Crosby told his
wife, “squealing like a pig in a hornet’s nest, and
frightened almost out of his wits, with Constable
Pettit marching him along by the ear. ‘Constable,’
I says, ‘what is that and where did you get it?’ He
says to me: ‘I dunno what it is, Ben, but it looks
foreign. I found it down by the railroad tracks trying
to eat a raw potato. When I asked it what its name
was, it said: “See.” ’ I says to the constable, ‘He
may be a Gipsy or he may be a Hindu, and he looks
as if he suspected you of being a cannibal. But,’ I
says, ‘he seems wiry and he didn’t get that lovely
tobacco-brown finish of his at a pink tea or from working
in an office. Now I need hands worse than ducks
need ponds. So turn him over to me ’stead of sticking
him in the calaboose, and I’ll give him a job.’
Pettit didn’t want to be bothered with him, so he
turned him over to me, and there he is out at the
pump washing the dirtiest pair of hands I ever did
see, and now and then rubbing his belly to show how
hungry he is. I’ll send him to the back door, Hannah;
you give him a lining of ham and eggs and pie,
and then send him down to me. I’ll be in the twenty-acre
lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently there came a knock on the back door of
the Crosby house. It was not at all a robust knock;
it was a tap as faint and timid as a butterfly’s kick.
Mrs. Crosby opened the door, and saw a small man
standing there; his face was a rich brown, his eyes
were black and apprehensive; he appeared to be
ready to flee if the occasion demanded it. When he
saw Mrs. Crosby, however, he bowed deeply. Such
a bow had never before been executed in Crosby Corners
except in the moving pictures. It was a sweeping,
courtly thing, that bow, in which the small man swept
off his wide felt hat and dusted the steps with it. Then
he smiled; it was a humble, ingratiating smile. He
looked toward the stove, where the sizzling ham was
sending its aroma heavenward, and sighed. Mrs.
Crosby pointed to a chair at the kitchen table, and
he, with another bow, took it, and presently he was
eating hungrily and freely. Mrs. Crosby now and
then lifted an eye from her canning to regard the exotic
stranger; she had a doubt or two at first whether
it was quite safe for her to stay there. You never can
tell what the foreigners may do, even if you are past
forty and the mother of a grown daughter. She
glanced into the dining-room, where, above the mantel,
hung Grandpa Crosby’s Civil-War sword, a long,
heavy weapon, and its presence reassured her. As she
studied the man, she decided that any fear of him was
quite groundless; if anything, he was afraid of her.
His hair, she observed, was blue-black and long, but
arranged in a way that suggested that he was a bit of
a dandy. The stranger’s trousers surprised her greatly;
they were of black velvet, really painfully tight,
except at the bottom of each leg, where they flared
out like bells. He had no belt, but instead a scarlet
sash. His shirt, when new and clean, must have been
a remarkable garment; it had been plaid silk, but it
was now neither new nor clean. His boots were of
patent leather and excessively pointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had eaten a very great deal he arose,
bowed, smiled beatifically, and made gestures of
gratitude. Mrs. Crosby pointed in the direction of the
twenty-acre lot, and he understood. She saw him
picking his way down the path; he was the first man
she had ever seen whose gait at one and the same time
included a mince and a swagger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Ben Crosby came in to his late supper that
evening he announced:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was wrong about that new little fellow. He
doesn’t seem to have done farm work. He’s willing
enough, but he handles a hay-fork as dainty as if it
was a toothpick. And, say, he certainly is the most
scary human being I ever set eyes on. You should
have seen him when the tractor came into the field
with the mowing-machine. He gave a yelp and jumped
on the stone wall, and if there’d been a tree
handy, I guess he’d have climbed it. He looked as if
he was afraid the machine would eat him. Pete High,
who was driving it, said, ‘I guess it ain’t only his
skin that’s yellow.’ I hope Pete isn’t right. I hate a
coward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you let Pete High pick on him,” admonished
Mrs. Crosby. “Perhaps the man never saw a mowing-machine
before. I remember how scared I was
when I saw the first automobile come roaring and
snorting along the road. And so were you, Ben
Crosby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I didn’t let on I was,” replied her husband,
harpooning a potato.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you old hypocrite, maybe you didn’t; but I
saw you looking around for a tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed, and was on the point of sending a
potato to its final resting-place, when they both heard
a cry—a high, terrified cry that came through the
dusk. He started up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not Janey?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; she’s still in town taking her music lesson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is it, then?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They heard the patter of running feet on the path
outside; they heard the sound of feet landing after
a leap to the porch; they heard someone banging
frantically on the front door. Ben Crosby called out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flood of words in a strange tongue answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Velvet Pants,” he exclaimed, and flung open
the door. The small man, breathless, tumbled in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in the name of thunderation?” demanded
Ben Crosby. The small man pointed through the
open door with quivering fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see anything out there but the evening,”
said Ben Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ice!” cried the man, very agitated. “Ice!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want ice for?” asked Ben Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man made eloquent gestures; first he pointed
at his own face, then he pointed outside; his index finger
stabbed at the gloom once, twice, a dozen
quick times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ice! ice! ice! ice! ice! ice!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Ben, he means ‘eyes,’ ” exclaimed Mrs.
Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eyes? What eyes, Hannah? I don’t see any eyes.
There’s nothing out there but lightning-bugs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the circling fireflies flew quite near the open
door. The small man saw it coming, and made an
earnest, but only partly successful, attempt to climb
into the grandfather’s clock that stood in the corner
of the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ben Crosby threw back his head and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, dog my cats! if the little cuss ain’t afraid of
lightning-bugs!” he said. “Hey, Velvet Pants, look
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He plucked the man out of the clock with one big
hand, and with the other captured the firefly, and held
it near the stranger’s wide eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look,” said Ben Crosby in the loud tone that is
supposed to make the American language intelligible
to those who do not understand it when it is spoken
in an ordinary tone of voice. “Bug! Bug! No hurt!
Lightning-bug. LIGHTNING-BUG!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small man pulled away from the insect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not know lightning-boogs,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ben released his hold on the small man, and pointed
up-stairs; then Ben gave a highly realistic imitation
of a snore. The man comprehended, and his
velvet-clad legs twinkled up-stairs toward his bedroom.
Ben Crosby returned to his supper, shaking
his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It beats me,” he remarked to his wife. “He’s
afraid of mowing-machines and he’s afraid of lightning-bugs.
I wonder if he’s afraid of the dark. I
need farm-hands, but may I be fried like a smelt if
I’ll tell ’em bedtime stories or sing ’em to sleep.
What’s the world coming to, anyhow? Can you imagine
a real, honest-to-goodness farm-hand like Pete
High being afraid of lightning-bugs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boneheads are seldom afraid of anything,” remarked
Mrs. Crosby, pouring buttermilk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They heard the front door open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Janey,” said Mrs. Crosby. “Hello, dear.
Come right to the table. I’ve made ice-cream—coffee,
the kind you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janey, daughter of the household, came in, bearing
her guitar. She kissed both her parents. Janey was
nearly eighteen, a pretty, elf-like girl. All the masculine
hearts in Crosby Corners beat a little faster
when she went down the village street; her blue eyes
had been the cause of many black eyes. Her father
told her of the new man, of his extraordinary velvet
trousers, and of his still more extraordinary fears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little fellow!” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the harvest days hurried along, Velvet Pants
atoned somewhat for his lack of expertness as a
farmer by his unfailing good nature. He even learned
to speak a little English of a certain hesitant species,
but he had little opportunity to talk with his fellow-workers.
Mostly they ignored him, or, if they addressed
him at all, did so loftily and with contempt;
a man who paled at the sight of mowing-machines and
lightning-bugs was not of their stout-hearted kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The incident at the swimming-hole added little to
Velvet Pants’ reputation for bravery. The swimming-hole
was Sandy Bottom, where all the workers,
hot from their day in the fields, went for a cool plunge
after work. They noticed that Velvet Pants never
went with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How does he keep so neat and clean?” they asked.
It was Pete High who solved this mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yesterday morning,” said Pete, “I woke up earlier
than usual, and what do you suppose I see?
Well, I hear a tap, tap, tap, like somebody was stealing
down-stairs on his tiptoes. I peek out o’ the door,
and it’s Velvet Pants. Just for fun, I follow him.
He goes down to the creek, not to Sandy Bottom, but
a couple of rods down-stream, where the water ain’t
more than ankle-deep. He strips, and takes a stick
about the size of a cane and goes like this, ‘Ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah,’ and pokes at the bushes each time he says
‘ah.’ Then he gives one big loud ‘Ahhhhhhh,’ and
lunges with his stick at the bushes; then he bows low,
like he was an actor in a show. He takes a bath, then,
dabbing a little water on himself like a cat does; but
he doesn’t go in above his ankles. I guess he’s afraid
of the water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mebbe he ain’t much on swimming,” said one of
the other hands, “but he sure can twang a mean
guitar. He’s giving Janey Crosby lessons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pete High scowled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is, is he? First I heard about it. Well, the
first thing he knows he won’t know nothing. I’m not
going to have any wop——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She likes him,” teased the other man. “Says he’s
got such lovely manners; just like what you ain’t,
Pete.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She don’t know how yella he is,” Pete High
growled, “but she will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Saturday afternoons most of Crosby Corners,
men, women, and children, comes to Sandy Bottom,
bringing bathing-suits. It is not a very big pool; at
its deepest part it is not much over six feet deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How it happened that the small man with the velvet
trousers should be passing Sandy Bottom that Saturday
noon at the precise moment when freckled Johnny
Nelson was floundering in the water and calling loudly
for help does not matter. Why Johnny Nelson should
be drowning at all is something of a puzzle, for he was
the best swimmer in the county. It also happened that
just as Johnny was going down for the ninth or tenth
time and was calling piteously for Velvet Pants to
dive in and save him, Janey Crosby and a party of
girl friends came down to the pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They saw Velvet Pants, his dark face ivory colored,
trying to reach Johnny with a young tree wrenched
from the bank. The small man was a picture of
frantic helplessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Save me, Velvet Pants! Save me!” bawled Johnny,
submerging, and coming up for the fourteenth time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not know how,” screamed Velvet Pants in agony.
“Not know how.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janey Crosby and her companions grew mildly
hysterical; Johnny Nelson went down for the seventeenth
and eighteenth time, respectively. Velvet
Pants, finding that he could not reach Johnny with
the tree, had fallen on his knees, and with clasped
hands was praying aloud in his own tongue. Then,
it also happened, that Pete High came racing through
the bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll save you, Johnny,” he cried dramatically.
Overalls and all, he plunged in and brought the dripping
Johnny to the bank. The prayers of Velvet
Pants became prayers of thanksgiving. Pete High
stood regarding him with disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Velvet Pants,” said Janey Crosby, “why
didn’t you jump in and save him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly, sadly the small man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not know water,” he said; “not know sweem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not seem nearly so abashed as he said this
as he might very well have been in the circumstances;
he said it very much as if he were stating a fact, a
lamentable fact the truth of which he regretted, but
a fact, nevertheless. He looked dismayed and surprised
when Janey Crosby and the others turned
away from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that Velvet Pants was an outcast. The men
spoke to him only when it was necessary to do so,
and then briefly and even harshly. He did not seem
to understand; he would try to tell them things, making
many gestures; but he had not the words to
make himself clear, nor had they the inclination to
listen to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evening, when the men were sitting about
the porch, competing for Janey Crosby’s smiles, there
was no place for him there. He had tried to join
in their talk and play, to be friendly, to be one of
them; they froze him out, and still he did not seem
to understand that they did it because he was so
flagrant a coward. At last he seemed to accept his
status as a pariah without really understanding it,
for he would take his guitar, which he had constructed
from the ruin of an old one, and go alone into the
woods. It was said that he sang there to himself, sad
songs in his native tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janey Crosby’s birthday came toward the end of
the harvest season, and it was the most important
social event of the year in Crosby Corners. All the
village was invited, and all the village came, the
girls in their fresh dimities, the men, soaped and collared
and uncomfortable, but happy. They brought
presents, as if they were bringing tribute to a queen,
and Janey, as graciously as a reigning sovereign, took
them all, and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party was held in the masonic hall, and it was
an affair of considerable tone, with dancing, two helpings
of ice-cream all around, and a three-piece orchestra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dancing was half over. Janey and Pete High,
her current partner, had gone out on the porch; a
harvest moon silvered the village streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look,” exclaimed Pete, “what’s that sitting down
there on the horseblock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a man,” said Janey, her eyes following his
pointing finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But who can it be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked again, and made out a small, bent
figure sitting there, chin on hands, eyes turned toward
the lighted hall, ears toward the music and the
buzz and laughter of the guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s Velvet Pants!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I chase him away?” asked Pete, swelling
out his chest and looking belligerent. Janey laid a
restraining hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; don’t chase him, Pete. Let him stay. The
poor fellow’s probably lonesome. Everybody is here
but him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He deserves to be lonesome,” said Pete; “he’s
yella.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you jump in to save a person from drowning
if you didn’t know how to swim?” asked Janey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I would,” replied Pete, promptly.
“Now, see here, Janey Crosby, don’t you go sticking
up for that wop. He’s not fit to associate with
white men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat gazing at the small, miserable figure; then
she made a sudden resolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to ask him to come up to the party,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you ain’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose birthday is this, Pete High? I guess it
won’t do any harm to give him a dish of ice-cream.
You don’t have to associate with him. Run down
and tell him I’d like to see him, Pete.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pete mumbled protests, but he went. Very diffidently,
as if he momentarily expected to be kicked,
Velvet Pants approached the porch. Janey Crosby
saw that he was wearing a new, clean shirt, that his
black locks had been parted and buttered, and that
his shoes had been rigorously shined. Over his
shoulder was slung his wreck of a guitar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is my birthday, Velvet Pants,” said the girl.
“I want you to help me celebrate it. Pete, will you
get another plate of ice-cream?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small man seemed overcome; he bowed twice
very low. Then he spoke. He spoke mechanically,
as if the words had been often rehearsed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haf no gif’ for you on your birthday, Mees
Crosby, but I haf learn a song American to seeng
for you. I hear heem on funnygraf. I hope you
like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said it humbly, but not without a certain pride
that attends the accomplishment of a difficult feat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janey laughed delightedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you learned an American song just for my
birthday? Well, now, wasn’t that a sweet idea! Wait!
I’ll call the others; no, better still, you come in the
hall and sing, so they can all hear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Velvet Pants looked horrified at this suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, no,” he protested. “I do not seeng good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right. They won’t know the difference,”
said Janey, laughingly. “Come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pushed him through the open doorway. The
guests looked up; what would Janey Crosby do next?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Folks,” announced Janey Crosby, “Mr. Velvet
Pants is going to sing for us. He learned a little
American song just for my birthday. Wasn’t that
nice of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was evident from the face of Pete High, who
stood in the doorway, that he did not think it was
particularly nice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small brown man glanced uncertainly about
the hall; then he began to play chords on his guitar.
Some of the girls tittered. In a round, clear tenor
Velvet Pants began to sing:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='line0'>Kees me hagain, and hagain.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>His memory seemed to go back on him at this
point; he groped for a moment for the words, then
plunged on:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='line0'>Kees me, kees me, hagain!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>When he had finished, Velvet Pants bowed deeply
first to Janey, then to the rest. There was a slight,
dubious ripple of applause that was checked suddenly.
Pete High had strode up to Velvet Pants and
was facing him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute there,” said Pete. “You and me
has got a little bone to pick. Wadda you mean by
singing a song like that to Miss Crosby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small man looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ees only song American I know,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah? Well, I’m goin’ to teach you to sing it
out of the other side of your mouth. Come outside
with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pete High,” broke in Janey, “don’t you go fighting
with him. He didn’t mean any harm; he probably
doesn’t know what the words mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told him never to say anything to you whether
he understood it or not,” stormed Pete. “Come on,
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Velvet Pants made an attempt to steal away, but
Pete blocked his path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re going out on the lawn with me,” said
Pete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And seeng?” asked the little man, who seemed
somewhat dazed by what was happening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do not hate you, Meester Pete.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I hate you. Come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how we fight?” inquired the small man; he
was pale beneath his tan, and trembling. For answer
Pete thrust a clenched fist under the man’s nose. The
man drew his head back and shivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” he said, shaking his head; “no! no! no!
no! no!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t fight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a coward,” declared Pete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Velvet Pants shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not know hand-fights,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pete slapped him across the face with his open
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now will you fight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not know hand-fights,” said the man, drawing
away. Pete, contempt on his face, gave him a push
into the night. They heard the sound of feet on the
path; Velvet Pants was running.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not know hand-fights,” Pete mimicked. “Did
you ever in your life see such a rat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day excitement swept Crosby Corners. Defender
Monarch had gone crazy, and when that news
spread, they forgot all about the conduct of Velvet
Pants on the night before. As for him, he went
about his work with a puzzled and hurt look on his
brown face; he seemed still uncertain why the others
did not respond to his smiles and attempts at friendliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Defender Monarch was the pride, and the terror,
of the county. His owner, Ben Crosby, had raised
him from a gawky calf, wobbly on his legs, into a
massive ton-and-a-half bull, with a chest like a haystack,
a voice of thunder, and the temper of a gouty
demon. Ben Crosby had not dehorned him, because
in cattle shows a good pair of horns is considered a
point of merit in judging bulls, and the giant bull had
won many blue ribbons. On this day Ben Crosby
wished most earnestly that he had foregone the blue
ribbons and taken off those horns. A savage bull
without horns is bad enough, but a savage bull with
a pair of sharp, wicked horns is just about the most
dangerous animal that walks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps on that morning Defender Monarch had
realized that he had reached the end of his usefulness,
and that before very long he was doomed to end a
proud career, ingloriously, as steak, roast, and stew.
He stood in his pasture, roaring a challenge to the
world that he would die fighting. By blind luck Ben
Crosby was able to trick him into entering the big
pen, but in the process Defender Monarch had given
a sample of his viciousness by ripping Johnny Nelson’s
arm from elbow to shoulder and had failed
by a hair’s-breadth in a sincere attempt to crush the
life out of Ben Crosby himself. Once confined in
the pen, Defender Monarch’s rage knew no bounds.
He hurled himself against the thick board sides so
furiously that they creaked and trembled, and the
crowd that had gathered to see him darted back to
places of greater safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily, the pen was a stoutly built affair; it was
not really a pen at all, but a small corral, perhaps
fifty feet square. About it moved Defender Monarch,
his small eyes blazing, alert. And, perched on boxes
and ladders, Crosby Corners, fascinated as all men
are by dangerous things, watched the mad king of
the herd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t he just too terrible,” said Janey Crosby to
Pete High.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know,” answered Pete, airily. “I’ve
worked round him often.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not since he went crazy, Pete.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” admitted Pete, “mebbe not. I’m used to cattle
of all kinds, but I never saw one that acted this
way. Just plain bulls I’m none too fond of fooling
with, but a crazy one! Excuse me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See how he’s looking right at us with those mean
little eyes of his,” said Janey. “It’s just as if he
were saying, ‘If I only had you down here for a
minute!’ I’m scared, Pete.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m here,” said Pete High, reassuringly. “Look,
Janey, he’s getting another fit; he’s going to try to
buck that opposite wall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janey Crosby, to get a better view, climbed to the
very top of the stepladder that leaned against the
wall of the corral. There was a sharp crack as the
top rail gave way, then horrified cries. She had
fallen into the pen, and lay unconscious almost at
the feet of the mad bull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The women screamed, the men ran about aimlessly,
wildly, shouting orders at one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help! Janey’s fallen into the pen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he’ll kill her! he’ll kill her! he’ll kill her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get pitchforks!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get a gun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No use; we’ve only got bird-shot. It would just
make him madder to hit him with that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Someone will have to jump in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you running to, Pete High?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To get a rope or something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Defender Monarch looked down at the girl, and
his eyes were evil. Then he looked at the ring of
white faces that lined the top of the corral. He seemed
to understand the situation; he seemed to know
that he had plenty of time, and he gloated. He
turned away from Janey, trotted to the farther end
of the corral, wheeled about, and surveyed the distance
between himself and the girl’s body; then he
lowered his head with his gleaming prongs, and
gathered his body for a charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The aghast onlookers became aware that something
was in the corral besides the girl and the bull.
A figure had come through the gate of the inclosure,
silently and swiftly. It was a small man in velvet
trousers and he was strolling toward Defender Monarch
as casually and placidly as if the bull were a
rose-bush. On the brown face of Velvet Pants there
was not the slightest trace of fear; indeed, he was
smiling, a slight, amused smile. Otherwise he was
as matter of fact as if he were about to sit down to
his breakfast. A brown-paper cigaret hung limp
from one corner of his lips; with the mincing strut
they had noticed and made fun of, he walked slowly
quite near to Defender Monarch. The animal, distracted,
stood blinking at the little man. Within a
few feet of the bull, Velvet Pants halted; with magnificent
nonchalance he blew a cloud of smoke into
the bull’s face, and then they saw a flash of something
red. It was Ben Crosby’s red flannel undershirt
that a few moments before had been drying on
the line. The small man had flicked it across the
bull’s face. Defender Monarch forgot for the moment
his plan for smashing Janey Crosby; he saw
the red, and he plunged toward it. The women turned
their heads away, the men clenched their teeth. They
saw Velvet Pants slip aside with the quickness of a
jungle cat, and the bull, unable to check himself, jolt
his head against one of the sides of the corral. Velvet
Pants turned round, smiled pleasantly, and bowed
very low to the spectators. They saw that he had in
his right hand something long and bright that caught
the rays of the sun; they realized that it was Grandpa
Crosby’s old Civil-War sword that had hung in the
dining-room. He was holding it as lightly and as
easily as if it were a butter-knife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Defender Monarch, recovering from his fruitless
charge against the wall, spun about; once more the
red shirt was deftly flapped before his bright, mad
eyes. Once more, with a roar of wrath, he launched
his bulk straight at Velvet Pants. Then something
happened to Defender Monarch. It happened with
such speed that all the onlookers saw was a flash;
then they saw the huge frame of the bull totter,
crumple, and sink down. Sticking from the left
shoulder of the bull they saw the hilt of Grandpa
Crosby’s sword; they saw the hilt only, for Velvet
Pants had driven the point into Defender Monarch’s
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The people of Crosby Corners allege that Ben
Crosby kissed the little tanned man on both cheeks, but
this he denies; he admits, however, that he hugged
him and patted him, and said many husky words
of gratitude and admiration to Velvet Pants, who
seemed abashed and quite unable to understand why
everyone was making so much of a fuss about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I called you a coward,” Ben Crosby kept
saying. “I called you a coward, and you went in
and faced a mad bull without batting an eyelash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was nuzzing,” murmured the small brown man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing to face a mad bull?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Velvet Pants shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am a toreador,” he said. “In my country,
Andalusia, I keel one, two, t’ree bull every Sunday
for fun. Why should I fear bulls? I know bulls.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch6'>A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span> MET him again in this way: The revolving door
of the excessively fashionable St. Erdman
Hotel was spinning around furiously—and yet no one
came forth. My eye spied this phenomenon; and,
ever curious, I paused on Fifth Avenue and watched.
Round and round sped the door like the Ferris Wheel
in a squirrel cage propelled by an athletic squirrel
gone mad. So fast did the door revolve that with
difficulty I made out a small figure in a brown suit
in one of the compartments. It was he who was making
a whirligig of the door. Then I saw another
figure, very bulky and cholerically red in the face
and wearing the purple-and-gold livery of the hotel,
stop the buzzing door and with outraged thumb and
forefinger pick up the little man in brown by the
collar, pop him out of the door like a tiddleywink
and send him bouncing across the sidewalk in my
direction. The little man picked himself up, apparently
not in the least angry, cast not a single
malediction at the broad purple back of the doorman,
but began to brush himself off thoughtfully.
Then I saw that he was Hosmer Appleby, with whom
I had had a casual acquaintance in college some five
years before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why hello, Appleby,” I greeted him. “Are you
hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not have one,” was his reply. “I do not
like them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stared at Appleby, uncertain whether he was
dazed by his recent experience, or was perhaps psychopathic,
or had been drinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not like what?” I queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Revolving doors,” he said. “I’ve tried them in
seven buildings now, and I don’t like any of them.
No; I shan’t have one. That’s settled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He addressed me as if I were trying to compel
him to have a revolving door, willy-nilly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, there,” I said soothingly, convinced now
that his mind was affected. “You need not have revolving
doors if you don’t want them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what kind shall I have?” he demanded,
looking at me anxiously. “What kind would you
have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have? For what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, for your house, of course,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have no house, Appleby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I fancied that he looked at me pityingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither have I,” he said; “but I am going to
have one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you? Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whereabouts in the country?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know yet.” Then, in a tone that was rapt,
if not actually reverent, he said, “Yes, some day I’ll
have a house in the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I knew,” Appleby said. “As soon as I
save enough to build the house and to provide a small
income for myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re married then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no; no, indeed. Nothing like that,” he assured
me hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what the dickens do you want with a house
in the country?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you,” said Appleby. “Where can we
go and talk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I suggested a certain coffee house, hidden away in a
side street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The coffee,” I said, as we started there, “is the
best Java in New York. It is raised for the exclusive
use of a royal family in Europe; but now and then
the royal steward sells a bag to this coffee house. It
has to be smuggled in, bean by bean; the man said
so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Smuggled in, bean by bean,” repeated Appleby.
“Do you think I could get a bag?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A whole bag? What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For my house, of course,” he said. “I could
serve it at the housewarming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, “it strikes me that a fellow who
plans what sort of coffee he’ll serve at the housewarming
of a house that isn’t even started yet must
like to peer into the future.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” said Appleby seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we neared the coffee house he suddenly darted
from my side. With some apprehension I saw him,
by a somewhat hazardous display of gymnastic ability,
mount a window ledge that he might examine closely
one of the old ship lanterns that served to light the sign
of the coffee house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He climbed down, shaking his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t do,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t do what?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t do for my house,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we entered the vestibule he dropped to his knees
and ran an appraising hand over the doormat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too prickly,” he announced. “For me, at any
rate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We took a table in the little back room, and while
Appleby inquisitively fingered the curtain material
and searched the bottom of the sugar bowl for the
maker’s mark, I examined him. Save for the addition
of a blond snippet of mustache, he was much
the same as he had been in college. He wore the
same sort of assiduously brushed brown suit, the same
careful necktie, the same intent, intense air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see the Yale game this year?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but let me tell you about my house,” he
answered. “Just now it’s to be a rather simple affair
of, say, ten rooms; a low, rambling house of the
English type, with plaster walls showing the trowel
marks; or I may have it of field stone, with a beamed
ceiling in the living room and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why are you going to build it, Appleby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked solemn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because of my philosophy of life,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is what I mean,” he explained: “I came out
of college about as well prepared for life as a snake
is prepared to ride a bicycle. I’d no idea what I
wanted to do. First, I thought I’d like to be a painter;
I lived on art and sausages for five months; then I
ran out of paint and sausages. So I went to work
in an advertising agency. I’m not just sure now why I
did. I think I ran into some fellow who said advertising
was a young giant still in its infancy and advised
me to get in on the ground floor; I remember
the metaphor, if not the fellow. I did get in on
the ground floor and I stayed there for four months.
Then I lost interest in the superlative merits of the
hair restorer my company advertised, and left the
young giant still in its infancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The coffee came; he absent-mindedly, drank some.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I entered finance,” he went on. “That is to say, I
trekked all over town trying to find someone feeble-minded
enough to buy a bond from me. Not finding
anyone, I entered foreign trade; meaning, I sat
at a desk and tried to sell dolls in gross lots to Peruvian
importers. I did this for some endless months.
One day I found myself looking out of my ninth-story
window and wondering why I didn’t jump. ‘Why,’
I found myself asking myself, ‘do I continue to live?
Do I care a snap about dolls in gross lots? I do
not! Do I like Peruvians? Not at all! In fact,
they both bore me. Life,’ I said to myself, ‘is as
empty as a used cantaloupe.’ What had I to live
for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Appleby sipped his coffee, and I said I didn’t know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” he said; “nothing. What was my life?
Same routine. Get up in the morning; miserable business,
getting up. Shave myself; always painful;
tender skin, you know. Breakfast; same old coffee,
same old cereal, same old eggs. Jostle down to the
office. Same dolls; same Peruvians. Lunch with
earnest young exporters; same oatmeal crackers and
milk; same talk about profits and markets. Back to
the office; ‘Miss Gurry, take a letter: “Yours of the
fourteenth received, and in reply would say in re
shipment of 325 gross of best India-rubber dolls, style
7BB—squeaking—am shipping same f.o.b., Wappingers
Falls, N. Y., at once.” ’ Oh, you know the
line. Home to my apartment, the size of a police
patrol. Read the papers. Same old bunk. ‘Strike
Situation Serious.’ ‘International Situation Serious.’
‘Pugilistic Situation Serious.’ Everything serious,
everybody serious. Dinner; that’s serious too. Same
old question: What shall I do to kill the evening?
Read a book? The usual bunk; either romance about
people who are too happy, or realism about people
who are not happy enough. Go to a show? The
old plots, the old lines, the old girls. Same banalities;
same strutting hams spouting moss-covered
buckets of bunk. Call on a girl? Ghastly bore.
Same old ‘Have you seen this or have you read
that? Isn’t it shocking about the Warps getting a
divorce, or nice about the Woofs getting married?
Do you believe a man and a girl can really be friends
in the strictest sense of the word, and how is your
golf game getting on?’ Home to bed, wind the alarm
clock; same old dreams, and then—br-r-ring—7:30
same thing all over again. I was slaving at work I
hated, and what was I getting out of it? What was it
all leading to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he sipped coffee; again I said I didn’t know;
again he launched himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” he said; “nothing. There I was at
twenty-four doing work I loathed in order to lead a
life that bored me. The whole business seemed as
pointless as an aquarium without fish. What could
I do to make life worth living?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what did you do?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First, I analyzed the situation. I always was
analytic, you know. Then I decided what I must
do. I must have some definite object to work for.
I must set some goal for myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tossed off his coffee with a triumphant air;
his eyes sparkled. I signaled for more coffee and
looked at him interrogatorily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the goal?” I questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was alive with excitement as he said,
“To have a house in the country; to retire and live
there and raise roses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re pretty young to retire,” I remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I won’t be able to do that for years and years,”
Appleby said. “I’ll not only have to earn enough
for a house but enough to bring me in a modest
income.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you have your definite object.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have,” said Appleby. “And you’ve no idea
how it has bucked me up. I’ve gained ten pounds
since I thought of it. And my whole outlook has
changed; I’m as happy as a cat in a fish store these
days. You see, I’m going to build a perfect house.
I take all the building magazines. Every Sunday I
go walking in the country looking for sites. And as
for my job——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You like it now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not. I’m still distinctly bored by dolls in
gross lots, and Peruvians; but I take them seriously
now. They’re pawns in my game, you see. Now,
every time I sell a gross of dolls I say to myself,
‘Ah, 144 dolls means a commission to me of $4.77,
or enough to pay for one electric outlet in my house.’
Or, if I sell ten gross I say to myself, ‘Good work,
old boy! The commission will buy andirons, or
bricks for the chimney, or so many gallons of paint.’
I’m three times as good a business man as I was.
Indeed, I should be at my office this minute, but I
got thinking about revolving doors and could not be
easy in my mind till I tried some. I don’t think
they’d be appropriate for a country house, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Decidedly not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked relieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! Glad you agree. I’ll cross them off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took out a fat memorandum book and crossed
words off a list.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do you expect to make this dream a reality?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wistful look came to his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I do it by the time I’m fifty I’ll be lucky,”
he said. “There isn’t much money in dolls. It will
take years. But”—and he brightened—“I have already
set aside enough money to pay for one window
with leaded glass, one foot scraper, three electric
outlets and part of the coal bin. Have you any ideas
about coal bins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before I could give him the benefit of my thought
on this subject he vanished from my sight. I perceived
that he had dived under the table and was
subjecting the floor to a microscopic scrutiny. Presently
he looked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wanted to be sure whether the floor is painted
or stained,” he explained. “I think I’ll have my
floors painted.” There was pride in his voice as he
accented the word “my.” He got to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must rush along. Hope I can sell a few
gross of dolls before the market closes. Glad I ran
into you. By the way, if you hear of anybody who
wants to buy dolls——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not finish his sentence, for his attention
was caught by the door-knob of the front door and
he bent over to see how it worked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he went out. I did not see Hosmer Appleby
again for six years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>New York eats men. It ate Appleby. At least I
did not encounter him. He may have ridden in the
same cars or lived in the same block; but our paths
did not cross until one afternoon at the art museum.
It was, as I recall it, just six years after we drank
coffee together and he told me about his aim in
life. I was in one gallery of the museum looking at
a new exhibition of etchings, when I heard a commotion
in the next gallery. A bass voice was in somewhat
violent controversy with a tenor voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you can’t lie in that there bed,” the bass voice
protested loudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why can’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That there bed,” declared the bass voice, “was
slep’ in by Napoleon. It’s worth twenty thousand dollars.
We can’t have people layin’ in it, now can
we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m only trying it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s against the rules of the museum,” stated the
bass voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I entered the gallery at this moment and saw a fat
and agitated museum attendant, owner of the bass
voice, expostulating with a small man in a brown suit,
the tenor, who was reclining on an enormous gilt,
canopied, four-poster bed of florid design.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very well,” said the man on the bed. “I
don’t think much of it as a bed, anyhow. I wouldn’t
have it in my house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saying this, he rose from the bed and I saw that
he was Hosmer Appleby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you wouldn’t, wouldn’t you?” said the attendant,
loyal to his charge. “Well, it was good
enough for Napoleon, that there bed was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steel beds are more sanitary,” said Appleby.
Then turning to me, “Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke as if I’d been with him all the time. He
had the same absorbed expression, the same intent,
intense look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s the house?” I asked. “Are you enjoying
living in it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Living in it? Why, I haven’t started to build it
yet!” he told me as we strolled through the collection
of Sheraton furniture, which he now and then stopped
to poke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he continued, “I haven’t found a site.
Haven’t the money, anyhow. But I’m looking. I suppose
I’ve looked at five hundred sites since I saw
you, and have got forty earaches listening to real-estate
agents. I’m in no great hurry. The perfect
house on the perfect site—that’s my plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said it as if he were annunciating a religious
principle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the dolls?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made a wry face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I still sell the little beasts,” he replied. “I’m
assistant sales manager now, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good work!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beastly grind,” he said. “I detest dolls. But
they’re going to build me a house in the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A doll house?” I suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not smile; his look said that his house was
too sacred a matter for facetiousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you, anyhow? Married, or anything
like that?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The living room is going to be thirty-five by
twenty,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stopped to admire a Fuller landscape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t those shadows lovely?” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My living room is going to be very bright,” said
Hosmer Appleby. “Splotches of brilliant color everywhere.
Old Spanish.” He said this in a confidential
whisper, as if he were imparting a secret. “And,
do you know,” he concluded, “I’ve earned almost
enough to furnish the living room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I congratulated him. He shook a rather woeful
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s fearfully slow work,” he said. “Sometimes
I think I’ll never make it. Sometimes I fear that the
house is a mirage that can never be reached. But
I conquer these fits of despair; I put on full steam
and sell dolls like a fiend incarnate.” He made a
face. “Little bores,” he added. We had reached
the front door of the museum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, good-by,” Appleby said. “Glad I saw you.
Let’s have lunch sometime. Have to go back downtown
and cable Peru. Just dropped in here to try
that Napoleonic bed. Now I can cross canopied beds
off my list.” He did so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I saw him make a hasty exit, and I saw his
brown-suited back disappear in pursuit of a bus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We never did have that lunch; he disappeared
from my life and it was some years before I saw
him again. It was at an auction. I heard an excited
tenor voice bidding on a dragon-sprinkled Chinese
rug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Appleby shook hands with me vigorously, without
taking his eyes off the auctioneer. He seemed in
excellent health and spirits; he had color in his cheeks
and a spark in his eyes. He bought the rug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This makes the seventh rug I’ve bought,” he
whispered to me breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s the house?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still in the blue-print stage,” he said, a little sadly.
“But I’ve earned nearly enough to pay for the first
floor. And I’ve got my eye on a wonderful site in
Connecticut. You should see the hanging lamp I
picked up at a sale last week! Very French and
cubistic.” His eyes glowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For your old-Spanish room?” I asked with a
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, now it’s going to be a modern French room,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still selling dolls, Appleby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, worse luck. I mean I still get no thrill out
of the work. But I’m to be made sales manager the
first of the year. That means more money, and every
dollar I make brings me nearer my house in the
country, and freedom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I left him bidding feverishly on a plum-colored
Cabistan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had almost forgotten Hosmer Appleby and his
house. A good many years had passed since our last
meeting—seventeen years, I think; or maybe eighteen.
Then one day last spring I received a note inviting
me to the housewarming of Briar Farm, near Noroton,
Connecticut; it was a very cordial little note, and it
was signed “Hosmer Appleby.” Then I knew that
he had attained his goal at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went out to Briar Farm to the housewarming.
The site was, indeed, perfect; five acres or so of rolling
land, with a view across Long Island Sound; and
the house itself was a gem. Hosmer Appleby, white-haired
now, but as bright-eyed and interested as ever,
greeted me warmly. He skipped from guest to guest,
rubbing his hands, bowing acknowledgments of the
compliments they offered him on the perfection of
his house. Now and then he pointed out some perfections
that might have escaped our attention—that
chair was from a sixteenth-century monastery near
Seville; that fireplace was his own design; the beams
in that ceiling he had discovered in an old manor
house in Somersetshire; he invented that especially
efficient shower bath; and didn’t we think that Matisse
in his library rather good?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took me to the library window, showed me
gleefully how the patent casement windows worked,
and said: “You see that garden out there? It’s to
be a rose garden. There I’m going to spend the rest
of my days; at night I’ll read in this room. It’s
been a long pull, I can tell you; but here I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve deserted the dolls?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made the face of one who has just taken unpleasant
medicine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t remind me of them,” he said. “I hope
I’ll never see one of the little brutes again. When
I think of the years I spent worrying and sweating
over them—still they helped me attain my objective.
I was president of the company, you know, when I
resigned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I was leaving his house he said to me, “You
must come up when the roses are blooming. They
ought to be beauties; I’ve been studying books on
rose growing for the last ten years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three months later I was driving near Briar Farm,
and I stopped in to see Appleby and his house and
the roses. I saw a figure in old clothes pottering
about in the garden. It seemed to me as I watched
him that his walk sagged. He would pick a rose bug
from a leaf, look at it for a whole minute or more,
put it into a can, and then pick off another rose
bug. He saw me standing there and came slowly toward
me. I thought he seemed pale. He shook hands
with me limply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How well the roses are getting on!” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think so?” he said without enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went into his living room—he had done it in
old-Spanish style, after all. I admired a venerable
refectory table. Appleby shrugged his shoulders.
There were long silences in the course of our conversation,
during which Appleby would sit with head on
chest, staring at a rug; and yet I felt somehow that
he did not see the rug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a stunning lamp!” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’ll do,” said Appleby; his tone seemed dull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you feel well, Appleby?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not particularly,” he said in that same blunted
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A week later I heard through a mutual friend that
Hosmer Appleby had taken to his bed, and that his
doctors were shaking their heads and looking grave.
I had it in mind to go out to see him, but business
called me suddenly to England for a flying trip. I
was gone a month. I came back to New York on the
newest and largest of liners, the Steamship <span class='it'>Gigantic</span>.
We tied up at a New York pier, and while waiting
for the customs inspectors to delve into our baggage
I decided to take a last stroll about the vast ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had penetrated into its depths and had come
to the place where one could peer down and see the
mighty engines, great polished and black giants
crouching in their cave. As I stood there I became
aware that a man, at no small peril to his safety,
was hanging out over the rail and studying the engines
with fascinated eyes. He was shaking his head and
muttering to himself as if he were in the midst of
calculation or inner debate. He heard my step and
swung around. It was Appleby. He bounded toward
me and shook hands with me with a hearty violence.
His face was full of color, and I have never seen
brighter eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, well!” he cried. “How are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine, thanks. And you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bully!” he said. “Bully!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what are you doing here, Appleby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got a pass and came aboard just as soon as
the boat docked,” he explained. His manner was
alert, almost jaunty, one would say. “You see, I
know the president of the line. I use his boats to
export some of my dolls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your dolls?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. I’m back in the doll business. And
I’ll bet you a good cigar we’ll sell half a million
dollars’ worth of dolls this year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was brisk, his air determined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your house in the country, Appleby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I sold that. Tell me, how did these new oil-burning
engines work on the trip coming over? You
see, I’m going to build myself a yacht. I’m working
like a beaver to earn the money. It’s going to be the
finest yacht that was ever built—the newest oil-burning
engine, mahogany decks, cabins for twenty or
more, elevators——”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>“Y</span>OUR name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“William Felton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, y’ronor, I was on m’post on Simpson street

<p class='pindent'>“Is that woman over there the one that got kissed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, y’ronor. That’s her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, officer. You may go. Will you take
the stand, Madam? What is your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elsa Keck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss, your honor, Miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your age, Miss Keck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—forty-one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you employed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a waitress in the White Tile Restaurant, corner
of Third Avenue and 149th Street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Been there long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-two years, your honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where do you live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At No. 1989 Second Avenue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With your family?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t got any family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With friends, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; furnished room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me exactly what happened last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, your honor, I was on the early shift, bein’
I been workin’ there at the White Tile longer than
any of the other girls, so I got off about seven and
I says to myself I can’t go home to that hot room
of mine this early so I guess I’ll go take in a movie
show, so I goes into the Idle Hour. It’s cool in there
and I can rest my feet, I says; if you ever done any
waitin,’ your honor, you know how hard it is on
the feet. Well, I goes in and they’re showin’ a lovely
picture all about an Arab prince that fell in love with
a white girl and carried her off to his tent and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please be as brief as possible, Miss Keck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, your honor, this man was sittin’ next to
me, and I paid no attention to him except to notice
that his face was sort of sickly and his eyes sort of
wild. I didn’t give him no encouragement, your
honor; I’m a decent girl. I just watched the film.
Well, I slipped my pumps off my feet and leaned
back to take it easy when all of a sudden he reaches
out and kisses me right on the face. I screamed. I
got all sort of hysterical. Then some men began
punchin’ him and the ushers dragged him up the
aisle and I was that upset—nothin’ of the kind ever
having happened to me before—that I screamed some
more; and when the cop come and asked did I want
to have him run in, I said I did. I was afraid the
men would kill him; they was beatin’ him something
fierce and he wasn’t very strong lookin’——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you want to press the case?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I dunno, your honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I do. I’m not going to let you withdraw
your complaint, Miss Keck. I happen to be the father
of nine children, six of them growing girls. For
their sake and the sake of the rest of the womanhood
of the city, I’m going to see if something can’t be
done about men like this. Is that man over there the
one who kissed you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, your honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, your honor; I couldn’t forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say you haven’t been kissed before——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, your honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean by a stranger in a moving-picture theater.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, your honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever been followed on the street by men, or annoyed
by mashers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never, your honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. You may stand aside, Miss Keck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your honor——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to be hard on this—this boy. I
guess he didn’t mean no harm; mebbe he’d been
drinkin’ or wasn’t right in the head or sumpin.’ I
guess I was sort of hysterical when I said I wanted
him run in. I don’t want to get him in trouble and
make him lose his job. Jobs is hard to get and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will do, Miss Keck. It’s too late now to drop
the case. You tender-hearted women, with your misplaced
sympathy, are to blame for mashers. I represent
the public, and the public can’t have young ruffians
going around kissing women old enough to be
their mothers. I’ve got daughters to think of, and
the daughters of other men, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, your honor——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will do, Miss Keck. Prisoner, stand up.
Well, Felton, you’ve heard the officer and you’ve
heard Miss Keck. What have you to say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, your honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak up, can’t you? Don’t mumble. Are you
guilty or not guilty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guilty, your honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you anything you’d like to say? I’d really
like to know why a quiet-looking young fellow like
you goes around acting like a beast; I really would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I—would like to say something, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well? Don’t mumble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I’m not a beast, your honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, why do you act like one then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t me, your honor. It was somethin’ in
me. I don’t know how to tell you. It ain’t decent
to talk about such things. The minister said so. I
never done anything like this before. Honest. It
just come over me—all of a sudden. I wouldn’t have
done it if she hadn’t taken off her shoe; it was the first
time I ever seen a foot—like that, you know—outside
of a store; I guess I got a devil in me or sumpin.’
Anyhow, before I knew it I’d done it and she was
screamin’ and the men was punchin’ me and kickin’
me and I didn’t know just where I was. I didn’t
mean to do it, your honor; honest, I didn’t; it just
happened—just happened——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense. Things like that don’t just happen,
Felton. Tell the truth. You went in there to annoy
a woman, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, your honor, no. I swear on the Good Book
I didn’t. I went in there so I wouldn’t annoy no
woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I—don’t like to talk about it, your honor. It
ain’t decent. But I can’t help it—— I got sumpin’
wrong with me, I guess. Always did have, ever
since I was a kid. I ain’t a bad one, your honor.
I go to church regular and I know my Bible and I
ain’t never been in no kind of trouble before. You
can ask Mr. Wirtz if I ain’t honest and sober and
hard workin’——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I work for him—down at the Elite Shoe Store on
Third Avenue—Jacob Wirtz—‘Fancy Feminine Footwear.’
He’ll tell you—Oh, I wish to God I never did
go to work there. That was what done it, your honor.
If I’d a been able to get a job as a chauffeur or a
salesman in the gents’ haberdashery or anything, it
wouldn’t have happened to me. But I didn’t know
nothin’ but shoes—nothin’ but shoes, your honor.
And they got me; I knew they’d get me; I did try to
fight ’em, your honor; night and day I tried. I prayed
every night, ‘Dear Jesus, don’t let the shoes get
me——’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, come, Felton. I haven’t time to listen to
you all day. If you have anything to say that bears
on your case, out with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m tryin’ to tell you, your honor. It—makes me
all ashamed. I don’t know how to tell things; I ain’t
talked much to people, except about shoes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shoes? What have they to do with your conduct?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They got everything to do with it, I guess, your
honor. It was them that made me do it—the shoes—— You
see, when I was a kid I wasn’t like the other kids—I
dunno why. Things made me excited—little
things that the other kids didn’t seem to mind. Things
made me tremble and shiver like I was freezin’. I
lived up-state in a little town with my uncle and
aunt. The other kids played with girls but I never
did; it made me all sort of nervous just to see ’em.
Once I went on a straw-ride when I was in the seventh
grade, and I sat next to a girl and I got so nervous
I threw up. Other boys wasn’t like that; but I
was——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My uncle took me outa high school to go to work
in his store. He kept a shoe store. I didn’t want to;
I wanted to be a sailor. But he made me. I didn’t
want to work in a shoe store, your honor. I was
afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—well, you see—your honor—he made me
wait on women. They had little feet, your honor,
such little feet. And some of them wore silk stockings——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, Felton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Ralph made me wait on them. He made
me. He used to crack me across the face because I
got sizes wrong; somehow I couldn’t think straight;
with men it was different; I didn’t get their sizes
wrong. But those little feet in the silk stockin’s——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at me, Felton. Anything more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was nervous and sick and I felt queer all over
and I used to think wicked things, your honor. I
couldn’t stop it; no matter how hard I prayed; I’d
just think and think—and I had to sit there and touch
those little feet in the silk stockin’s. It got worse and
worse—— Guess I got some kind of a disease,
your honor; I was always funny that way; and I
didn’t want to be, honest I didn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, your honor, I clerked along in Uncle
Ralph’s store for five years; I thought mebbe it would
get easier; worse, that’s what it got. Uncle give me
five dollars a week and my keep; but I couldn’t save
much. He made me give money to the missionaries
and when I made mistakes about women’s shoes, he
fined me. I wanted to save enough to take a course
to be an engineer on a steamship. I wanted to get
away—get away from the shoes. I was afraid I’d go
crazy or sumpin’, your honor. I was afraid I’d do, I
don’t know what. Uncle Ralph didn’t know; I didn’t
tell him; I knew he wouldn’t understand; he was a
good man and men’s shoes and women’s shoes was
all the same to him. But me, I was different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, your honor, one night in spring there was
a bargain sale and there was lots of women and girls
in the store, tryin’ on shoes. I began to feel very
queer and awful; it was wicked; I drunk ice water and
I prayed, but it done no good. I knew if I stayed
there I’d go clean crazy and perhaps do, I don’t
know what; a girl come in and she had red hair and
silk stockin’s and I had to try on her a pair of 2AA
pumps—she had the littlest feet you ever see, your
honor—and I took to tremblin’ and I kept sayin’
under my breath, ‘Dear God, don’t make me want to
kiss her; please don’t make me want to kiss her.’
An’ I guess He didn’t hear or sumpin’, or perhaps He
was punishin’ me, because, anyhow, I did want to;
I wanted to sumpin’ fierce. But I knew it would be
wrong and I didn’t want to disgrace Uncle Ralph
who was a good man and a deacon in the church. So
I ran right outa the store just as I was, without a
hat or nothin’ and I left her sittin’ there. I was so
nervous I could hardly see where I was goin’. I
ran all the way to the railroad station. I got on a
train, the first that come. It took me to New York.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, Felton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I got to New York I had one dollar left.
I looked for a job in a department store. The man
said. ‘Any sellin’ experience?’ And I said ‘Yes.’
He said, ‘What line?’ and before I knew it, like a
fool, I said ‘Shoes.’ So they put me in the Misses’
shoes. It paid sixteen a week. I thought mebbe I
could save enough to get married. I guess I oughta
have got married. But the fellas who was married
said, ‘Fat time a young fella has that marries on a
clerk’s salary! It ain’t so much the wife that costs;
it’s the kids.’ And I says ‘But have you gotta have
kids?’ And they said, ‘Of course y’ have. How you
goin’ to stop havin’ ’em?’ And I says ‘But s’pose
y’ can’t afford kids?’ They said, ‘Then it’s tough luck
for you,’ they said, ‘and for them.’ There was a
girl in the cotton goods, your honor, that liked me,
I guess. She was makin’ twelve. We could of got
married, mebbe, if it wasn’t for havin’ to have kids.
If I only coulda got married, your honor, I wouldn’t
be here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you are here, Felton. What else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the big store it was worse than Uncle Ralph’s.
All kinds of girls come to get shoes. I began to get
nervous again; I was scared I’d do sumpin’ wicked.
I tried to get work at the docks; they said I was too
light. I had to stay in the Misses’ shoes. I stayed
a year. Then I couldn’t stand it another minute. One
day when I was tryin’ a brogue oxford on a girl I
felt so bad I ran right out the store. I didn’t stop
for my pay or a reference or anything. I just run
right out and went into a movie because it’s cool and
quiet in movies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, your honor, I tramped all over town lookin’
for another job; everything was full up; I did get
a job carryin’ boxes in a lead pipe factory, but they
fired me after the first day; the boss said I didn’t
have the muscle. I didn’t have no money left—I’d
used up the money I’d saved to be married with—and
they put me outa the house I roomed in and
I didn’t have no overcoat and winter was here and
for three days I didn’t have nothin’ to eat but coffee.
I couldn’t stand it. I asked a man to give me a
quarter and he said, ‘You lazy bum, find a paper and
get a job.’ I did find a paper and it said ‘shoe salesmen
wanted.’ It was beginnin’ to snow and my head
felt light and queer and I guess I’m weak, anyhow,
so I went up to the Elite Store and they give me a
job at fifteen per. I been workin’ there nearly a year:
next week Mr. Wirtz was goin’ to raise me to sixteen—and
then I got into this trouble——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that all, Felton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, your honor. There’s a little more. It’s
about what happened last night. I was workin’ away
in the Elite and it was gettin’ worse and worse. The
older I got, the worse it got. I prayed, your honor.
But I guess I was made wrong or sumpin’. The other
fellas in the store didn’t mind; they was all married.
But I couldn’t get married on fifteen a week. I used
to walk miles every day; but that didn’t help none.
It got worse. Those little feet—your honor, there
oughta be a law against girls wearin’ silk stockin’s and
little patent leather pumps with red heels. Things
began to get worse; I was all sorta jumpy; all last
week I couldn’t sleep. Last night I felt sumpin’
comin’ on me like I felt in Uncle Ralph’s store that
night I run away; I was afraid—. It’s not decent to
talk about things like that, your honor——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, Felton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A girl come into the store; she was a red-headed
girl, your honor, and she had the littlest feet—and
she wanted patent leather pumps with red heels——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Felton. Take hold of yourself. If you’ve
anything more to say, say it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went to get the pumps—but I was tremblin’—and
the box dropped from my hand; I knew I couldn’t
stand it; I ran outa the store; I guess they thought
I was crazy or sumpin’; I went into the first movie
show I come to; I knew it would be cool and quiet and
dark—in there——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what then, Felton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They was showin’ a film there, your honor, that
there oughta be a law against; the girl wore silk
stockin’s and the man kissed her. There was a woman—that
woman there—sittin’ next to me and when
the fella in the picture kissed the girl, this woman
makes a little sighin’ noise, and I looked at her sidewise.
She seemed sorta old and tired lookin,’ your
honor, and skinny and plain and her eyes were sorta
sad and I said to myself, ‘I’ll bet she wishes she was
bein’ kissed, just like I wished I was bein’ kissed.’
‘And,’ I says to myself, ‘fat chance for either of us.’
‘And’ I says to myself, ‘I guess, mebbe, she wouldn’t
mind if——’ But I knew it was wicked so I turned
away and tried to watch the picture. And then——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Felton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then, your honor, I heard her movin’ and I
looked and she’d slipped off her pumps—and she
had little feet—and I’d never seen feet before outside
of the store—and then—I dunno why—but—I—kissed
her—and the next thing I knew they was
punchin’ and kickin’ me and the policeman had me,
twistin’ my arm and hurtin’ me sumpin’ fierce. I
didn’t mean to do it, your honor; it just happened—just
happened——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve listened to enough, Felton. More than
enough. I’m heartily ashamed that there are such
men as you in this country; you are unworthy of the
name of American, Felton. It is men like you who
can’t control themselves that worry the soul out of
the fathers of growing daughters. I can’t understand
why you don’t exercise a little self-control. Six
months in the city prison on Blackwell’s Island!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch8'>THE PRINCE HAS THE MUMPS</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>Y</span>OUNG Prince Ernest was ill. He had, in fact,
the mumps. “Beastly nuisance,” he remarked
to his valet. He wanted very much indeed to say
“damned inconvenience”; and, considering the circumstances,
even this would not have been putting
the case too strongly; but he did not say “damned
inconvenience,” because a prince must not set a bad
example; and, mumps or no mumps, Ernest Cosmo
Adelbert Oscar James never forgot that he was a
prince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every inch a prince,” said the newspapers of his
native land in referring to him, which they did in
every edition from the first, or bulldog, to the last,
or five-star extra-special sporting final.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That made sixty-six inches of prince, for Ernest
was a rather pretty boy of medium stature, with a
pink, almost waxen complexion, blond hair impeccably
parted, and a brow as unruffled as a pan of
skimmed milk. At the moment the symmetry of his
features was somewhat marred by the presence of two
mature mumps; and, noting this in the gold-rimmed
mirror near his bed, Prince Ernest gently groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Physiognomists might have argued from the
serenity of his brow that the prince was not a thinker;
but they would have been in error, for in his twenty-three
years he had, not infrequently, thought. Happily
his thoughts had not been disturbing ones. It
had taken no soul-struggle to make him entirely content
with his princely lot. Having been born a prince,
nursed as a prince, breeched as a prince, taught as
a prince, at twenty-three and a few days it seemed
completely natural to Ernest to be a prince. It
was quite impossible for him to imagine himself anything
else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes he thought: “Of course, I don’t say I
have a divine right to be a prince; nowadays that
isn’t considered in good taste. But, since I’m being
perfectly frank with myself, I must admit that there
is something—well, if not exactly sacred, at least
sacerdotal about royalty. Being a prince isn’t at
all like filling a place in the cabinet or the civil
service or the army, where almost any sort of fellow
can get ahead if he has enough push. A prince has
no use for push; he’s a prince, and that’s all there
is to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at other times he thought: “It’s the fashion in
these times to pretend that a prince is just like any
other man in the country, and not a bit better. That’s
rot, of course, and no one knows it better than the
people. If I am like all the rest of them, why do
they stand in the rain for hours to see me whisk by
in a limousine? Why do they crowd into some stuffy
hall to hear me tell them I am glad to be there, gazing
into their open, manly countenances?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Or, on other occasions, he thought: “To hear some
of these radical chaps talk one would think any fellow
could be a prince. Really, you know, that’s
nothing more than twaddle. If they tried it they’d
soon find that it takes generations of royal blood behind
one to give one that—well, that authority, that—so
to speak—presence. I’d just like to see one of
those long-haired johnnies try to lay a corner stone—with
the proper dignity, I mean. Why, the people
would laugh at him! They never laugh at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By nature a modest and candid young man, Prince
Ernest had but one vanity. He was proud of the appearance
he made at public functions. He loved
to lay corner stones, to unveil monuments, to visit
hospitals, to address meetings. On these occasions
he invariably made a neat speech, and he had never,
he was glad to say, in any of his speeches given
offense to anybody. He accepted, with becoming
graciousness, the tributes paid him by the crowds. It
pleased him exceedingly to hear his subjects punctuate
his speeches with their uncouth but sincere evidences
of approbation. Often he read about it afterward
in the press, and secretly glowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prince Ernest”—the front page of the <span class='it'>Morning
Stiletto</span> is speaking—“was greeted with vociferous
enthusiasm when he laid the corner stone of the new
polo field being built by the Coal Mine Workers’
Union for the use of its members. The prince shook
hands with a number of the men and made one of
his felicitous and witty speeches. In part His Highness
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I am always glad to speak to miners. [Cheers.]
I was once a minor myself. [Laughter.] Now, all
joking aside, and speaking seriously, I am glad to
be here and to look into so many open, manly countenances.
[Violent cheering and cries of ‘Every inch
a prince!’ and ‘Long live Bonny Prince Ernie!’]
Yours is a very important industry. [Cries of ‘Hear,
hear!’] I can’t think what I should do in winter if
it weren’t for coal. [Cheers, and cries of ‘God bless
Your Highness,’ and ‘Spoken like a prince!’] I repeat,
therefore, I am glad to be with you——’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, there was no question about it, his subjects
loved him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now he had the mumps. He was as puffy as if
he had attempted to swallow a pair of inflated water
wings, and when he drank a glass of water it was
like swallowing a string of biggish beads. Moreover,
he had a fever, and his royal knees felt decidedly
gelatinous, and the doctor had said he must stay in
bed. To get mumps at a time like this, he mused,
was almost unprincely. His country needed him, and
there he lay, ineffectual and mumpish. Indeed,
mumps at a time like this was nothing short of a
calamity, for on the morrow His Very Serene Highness
the Emperor of Zabonia was to pay an official
visit to the prince’s country. Fifty million people
held their breath and tremulously awaited the result.
Would there be war? Everybody knew that
the answer depended on the emperor’s visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Relations between the prince’s country and Zabonia
were strained—dangerously strained. Why had that
bellicose old fire eater, the Duke of Blennergasset,
made that intemperate speech in which he referred
to the Emperor of Zabonia as a “pompous elderly
porpoise with the morals of a tumblebug?” Why had
Count Malpizzi, the Zabonian Secretary for War, in
heated rejoinder seen fit to declare that as for Prince
Ernest’s father, the king, he was no lily of the valley
himself, and furthermore, Prince Ernest’s countrymen
were three degrees lower in the scale of existence
than the guinea pig? A painful and acute situation
had been created between the two countries; one puff
of the air of animosity on those smoldering embers
and the blood-red flame of war would break forth.
This eventuality would be highly inopportune for
Prince Ernest’s country, for Zabonia had just perfected
a cannon whose shell carried a hundred miles
and then bounced back to be recharged. War must
be averted. The Emperor of Zabonia must be received
with every show of cordiality, must be accorded
every honor, must be given not the slightest
shadow of a pretext for taking umbrage. The emperor
must carry away the impression that Prince
Ernest’s country loved Zabonia with a surpassing love;
the emperor must be made to believe that the Duke
of Blennergasset’s reference to him as a pompous
elderly porpoise was one of pure affection and esteem,
and that a comparison of the morals of His Very
Serene Highness to those of a tumblebug was an
idiomatic expression, and highly complimentary, inasmuch
as tumblebugs are popularly believed to lead
lives of singular probity and chastity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prince Ernest’s father, the king, had given orders
that his entire royal family, down to the most remote
ducal cousin, must be on hand to greet the Emperor
of Zabonia; and, of course, so the king stated,
it was of the highest importance that the heir apparent,
Prince Ernest, should be there. But how
could he be, for he had the mumps? It was an exceedingly
regrettable situation. These Zabonians
were a truculent and suspicious lot, and if the crown
prince were not present to greet their emperor they’d
read some subtle insult into it, you could depend upon
it. It was the custom for visiting monarchs to appear
on the balcony overlooking the plaza in front of the
royal palace to be cheered by the crowd which always
collected there on such occasions, and it was also the
custom, as the whole world knows, for the king to
stand on the right side of the royal visitor and the
crown prince to stand on the left. This was the
etiquette. From it there could be no deviation. If
the crown prince did not stand at the emperor’s left
hand tomorrow it would be instantly apparent to the
crowd that a slight was intended, and then no power
could hold back the hungry hounds of war; and war,
just now, with Zabonia would be extremely inconvenient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prince frowned at the obese pink cupids that
adorned the ceiling of the royal bedchamber. He
was too weak to do much else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor had just issued an ultimatum. The
prince must not be moved; to do so, the doctor assured
him, would be suicide. The king protested,
even pleaded. But the doctor, who, like most savants,
was stubborn, shook his white beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he must appear before the crowd,” said the
king, wringing his own whiskers, which were plentiful
and auburn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would kill him,” said the doctor with finality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I weren’t an only son I’d risk it,” said the
prince weakly, from his bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can bet you would,” said the king.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His Majesty paced the chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mumps!” he ejaculated. “And at such a time!
The crowd will never understand it!” He was patently
worried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then it was that the Count of Duffus, who was
Gentleman in Waiting in the Royal Bedchamber, had
a tremendous idea. He reduced his brain wave to
an excited whisper and poured it into the king’s ear.
The king beamed and nodded, at intervals saying,
“Good!” “Yes, yes, yes!” “Excellent!” “Splendid!”
“Ripping!” “By all means!” “Stout fellow!” “Good
old Duffus!” “The very thing.” “Quite so, quite
so!” “Admirable!” “Of course!” “Perfect!” and
other expressions of approbation. The Count of
Duffus, damp with the gentle dew of success, made
off; and the king turned to the prince, a twinkle in
his eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Invaluable chap, Duffus,” said His Majesty.
“Good idea of his. Should have thought of it myself,
tho. The old dummy dodge!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dummy dodge, father?” The young prince
raised un-understanding eyebrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll see,” promised the king, “when Duffus
gets back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It wasn’t often that the king talked with the prince
so familiarly. Usually there was an atmosphere
of formality about their relations; it was more as
if they were a friendly but not intimate king and
prince than a father and son. Sometimes, the prince
had noticed, the king was unusually aloof; there had
been days when the king had not spoken to the prince
at all; on other days His Majesty was more expansive;
today the king was positively clubby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the Count of Duffus did come back, and
with him a package so large that it took two able-bodied
footmen to carry it. With an air of having
accomplished something noteworthy, the Count of
Duffus stood the package upright by the prince’s bed
and began most carefully to peel off the wrapping
paper. He tore off the last piece of paper with a
flourish, and the prince’s eyes opened so wide that
his mumps hurt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the waxen figure of a fair-haired, smiling
young man in polo costume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s I!” exclaimed the prince, who, mumps
or no mumps, surprised or not, always expressed
himself correctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They do make those dummies more perfectly all
the time,” remarked the king, who was admiringly
examining the figure. “That nose is exactly like
Ernie’s, now isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prince lay staring at his effigy.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see——” he began as distinctly as the
mumps would let him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you will,” said the king. “Duffus, did
Madame Hassler make much of a fuss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, naturally,” replied the count. “She thought
I was balmy in the crumpet, probably. She said it
was the prize figure in the waxworks. Big drawing
card and all that. I had to pay her a hundred and
seventy goobecs before she’d part with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a lot of money,” said the king, a careful
soul; “but it will be worth it tomorrow. I’ll make
you a duke for this, Duffus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks awfully. Oh, look here, Your Majesty!
You can move its arms!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better and better!” exclaimed the king. “We can
make it salute.” The king turned to his son, who was
still more than a little bewildered. “Ernie,” said the
king, “where do you keep your uniform as honorary
colonel of the Royal Purple Bombardiers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever for, father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For your understudy here, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king’s expression just then indicated that he
did not consider that his son was a lightning calculator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you get the idea, Ernie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I begin to,” said the prince; “and, father,
I don’t like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king shrugged well-nourished shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the only way,” he said. “We can’t risk even
the appearance of slighting that touchy old hippopotamus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hippopotamus, father? I was not aware——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I mean that venerable muffin, the Emperor of
Zabonia,” cut in the king with a trace of impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, father,” said the prince, and his eyes showed
that he was shocked, “he is a king!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king was contrite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, son,” he said. “I shouldn’t speak like that
of royalty, I know. But I have so much on my mind
these days, with this tiresome visit and your mumps
and the shadow of war and heaven knows what.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, father,” said the prince, following up his
advantage, “please don’t ask me to permit this monstrous
thing. It’s not honorable. It’s not princely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king patted his son’s silk pajamaed shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pish-tush, Ernie!” he said playfully. “I wish you
wouldn’t always be so devilishly idealistic. You’re
so high-minded one needs to get on a stepladder to talk
to you. Wake up, Ernie. You’re old enough now not
to believe in Santa Claus any longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king’s tone grew more serious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve dreaded this day, Ernie,” he said, “on your
account. You’re such a naïve chap, you know. Still,
the day was bound to come. It’s like a fellow’s first
cigar—sickens him at first, but it’s the only way to
learn to smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” said the prince, “I don’t know what
you’re talking about. All I know is that it’s not right
to try to impersonate a prince in this way. That grinning
dummy there isn’t I. It can’t be I. Nobody will
be fooled. And furthermore, I don’t want to fool my
people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roll over and go to sleep, Ernie,” said the king.
“There are times when you give me a sharp pain in
the region of the waistcoat.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>From his bed the prince could see it all, the whole
damnable imposition. First he could see emerge the
full outlines of His Serene Highness of Zabonia. The
prince could see plainly the celebrated red nose of
that monarch; rather like an electric-light bulb in the
center of a round cheese, thought the prince, who had
a gift for simile. He wondered why the Zabonian
emperor insisted on wearing that ridiculous skin-tight
pink hussar uniform. Then the prince saw his father
step on the balcony, to cheers. His Majesty was in
the cream-and-gold uniform of a field marshal of the
King’s Very Own Royal Indefatigables, and he took
his place at the emperor’s side, bowing. Then came
the stunning blow to the mumps-stricken prince. Another
figure had appeared on the balcony, a very
erect, dignified figure in the dashing uniform of the
Royal Purple Bombardiers. The prince in the bed
perceived that the thing on the balcony was himself!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As, horrified, he watched, Prince Ernest saw the
thing’s hand go up in a precise military salute. The
great throng of people went wild. Their cheers made
the palace tremble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Viva our prince!” he heard distinctly. “Long
live Prince Ernest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lean man with a hungry face had eluded the
police and eeled his way to the top of a lamp-post in
the plaza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There he is!” called the man shrilly. “Every
inch a prince! Who’s every inch a prince?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their answer filled the air with sound—“Prince
Ernest! Prince Ernest! Prince Ernest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lying there, Prince Ernest saw the dummy back
majestically from the balcony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Long life to the prince!” screamed the man on
the lamp-post. “He never turns his back on his
people!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowds took up the cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Long life to Prince Ernest! He never turns his
back on his people!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And jolly good reason,” said the prince, “for
they’d see the strings Duffus is pulling to make the
thing salute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brow of the prince was no longer bland, no
longer was it free from lines of disillusionment. He
was thinking of what he had seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was tragic, as he said, “So this is what it
means to be a prince! A dummy serves just as well!
A dummy; the sort of thing they have in cheap ready-made
clothing stores—Very Nobby! Newest and
Niftiest Cut! Take Me Home for Fourteen Goobecs.
What a blind ass I’ve been! But it’s not too late. I’m
not going to go on with this miserable sham. I’m
not going to be a stuffed uniform any longer. If a
dummy can be a prince I don’t want to be. Let them
have a dummy in my place. I’m going to be a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He addressed these words to the emptiness of the
royal chamber, and his tone was steeped in the vinegar
of bitter realization. Prince Ernest was working
himself up to quite a pinch of resolution, when the
chamber door opened and in came the king. Behind
him wabbled the vast bulk and incandescent nose of
the Emperor of Zabonia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His Zabonian Serenity,” explained the king, “insisted
on coming to see you. His Serenity understands,
of course, why political expediency made it
necessary for you to be represented before the people
by a—er—substitute. Don’t you, Your Zabonian
Serenity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zshur,” rumbled the royal visitor; his voice was
thick as if his words came through a blanket. “I
didn’t know,” he added, “it wasn’t the prince until the
king told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emotions were bubbling and sputtering inside the
bosom of Prince Ernest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m ashamed,” said the prince, “to deceive my
people like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His Zabonian Serenity, who had taken a chair,
arranged two or three of his chins and part of his
expanse of jowl into a grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ernie,” cautioned the king, “no nonsense now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bottled-up feeling rushed from the prince in a
torrent of passionate words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, I’m going to speak out! I’m through with
this whole business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What business?” The king looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This prince business,” said Prince Ernest. “I
saw it all while I was lying here. What am I?
Nothing! Nothing, that is, but a—pardon the colloquialism—stuffed
uniform. A prince? Bah, a dummy!
That’s all I am! I step out and bow and smirk
and salute while some other chap pulls the strings.
The people don’t care a gingersnap about me. It’s
my uniform they cheer. Stuff it with wax or sawdust
or me, it’s all the same to them. Why, they’d cheer
it if it were stuffed with mush! So I’m through,
father! I can’t go on with this hypocrisy. Give the
dummy my place. I’m sorry to shock you, father.
You and the emperor probably have never thought
about things in this way. But don’t you see, a prince
is really only a dummy? Forgive me—but it’s true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young prince was almost hysterical. The king
did not appear to be in the least perturbed; he gave
the prince a fatherly pat on his shoulder and winked
at the Emperor of Zabonia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s only twenty-three and a few days,” explained
the king, “so naturally he takes it a bit hard. I did
myself—thought of entering a monastery—yes,
really.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His Zabonian Serenity chuckled deep in his cavern
of chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ernie,” said the king, turning to his son, and
speaking in his most kindly manner, “you’ve discovered
what all kings discover sooner or later. You’ve
found yourself out. Now your job will be to keep
the people from finding you out. Isn’t that so, Your
Serenity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zshur,” rumbled the visitor, sucking at a long
amber-scented cigaret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t want to keep them from finding me
out!” cried the prince. “I don’t want to go on living
this ghastly farce. I am going to work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king laughed jovially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Work?” he inquired. “At what, in heaven’s
name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something honest,” replied Prince Ernest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king laughed and nudged the emperor in his
imperial ribs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, youth!” said the king. “Ah, youth! By the
way, Ernie, how much did you spend last year?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know exactly,” replied the prince,
mystified. “The Royal Bursar of the Most Privy
Purse could no doubt tell you. Probably between
three hundred and four hundred thousand goobecs,
I fancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how many motor cars did you have?” questioned
the king.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eleven, if you don’t count roadsters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fair enough,” said the king. “We won’t count
roadsters. Now, Ernie, suppose you were a young
lawyer——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I were,” said the prince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At this precise moment,” pursued the king, “you’d
be in your office hoping some friend would fall down
a manhole so you could sue the city for damages.
You could consider yourself jolly lucky if you made
eight hundred goobecs a year. If you were a young
doctor you’d be sitting around with your hands in
your empty pockets praying for an epidemic. If you
were a young business man you’d be in a terrible stew
about your overhead or underfoot or whatever it is
business men get into a stew about. Instead of having
eleven motor cars, not counting roadsters, you’d be
fortunate to have your bus fare. Now I’m a doting
father, Ernie, but even I can see that you are no intellectual
colossus. And yet you acceptably fill a
job that brings you in three or four hundred thousand
goobecs a year, and eleven motor cars, not counting
roadsters. Despite all that, you talk of going on
strike. Really, Ernie, that’s preposterous. Isn’t it,
Your Zabonian Serenity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The emperor nodded and puffed at his scented
cigaret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pre,” he rumbled, “posterous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve a downy nest, my boy,” went on the king
benignly. “You’d be a chump to quit it. Come now.
Look at this thing through a microscope instead of a
pair of smoked glasses. Be a prince of the world,
not one of the Red Fairy Book. If the people are
dolts enough to let you keep the job, why put unpleasant
ideas into their heads?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, father”—the young prince was very pale—“forgive
me for saying it, but I do believe you are a
cynic!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I am,” answered the king cheerfully.
“That’s better than being the only other thing a king
can be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A blithering fool,” answered the king. “How can
a king with any sense respect his people? He sees
them bawling their beery cheers first about some
rather ordinary human being like yourself, for example,
Ernie, and then he sees them cheering one of
your silly uniforms stuffed with wax. The only way a
king who pretends to be civilized can regard his subjects
is as dupes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young prince lay scowling at the cupids. He
was thinking deeply. He said at last:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. You are saying this to try me. You are
testing my faith in the inherent strength of royalty.
It was weak of me to doubt. That dummy business
today did hit me hard; but, after all, it was only a
desperate ruse that by chance succeeded. You pretended
it is quite the usual thing; but, of course, it
isn’t. I implore you to tell me that it isn’t, father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king lit a cheroot and replied in an anecdotal
tone:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was your age, Ernie, I had a beautiful set
of whiskers and a still more beautiful set of ideals
about the sanctity of my position and all that. I still
have the whiskers. My dear old father suggested that
I grow the whiskers. ‘You haven’t much of a chin,’
he said to me. ‘I think you’d better keep your loyal
subjects in the dark about that. A king can be
human, but not too damn human. Also, there’s another
reason—whiskery men all look pretty much
alike.’ I did not understand then what he was talking
about; but many years later, after his death, I did. I
was scheduled to go to some dismal provincial town
and knight some pestilential bounder of a mayor.
I’d been performing a lot of royal chores, including
the coronation mumbo-jumbo, and I was a bit fed up.
The more I thought of going to that town the more
bored I grew. But of course I had to go. Was I not a
king? I took myself and my duties terribly seriously,
even as you do, Ernie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king unashed his cheroot in a gold tray and
went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I felt that only a king full of blue blood
could possibly knight a fellow properly. However,
on the night before the ceremony I drank a magnum
of champagne, and then made the strategic error of
adding a few glasses of 1812 brandy. Alcohol is no
respecter of royalty. In the morning I perceived
that if I tried to knight the fellow I’d probably decapitate
him. Here was a pretty kettle of whitebait.
I was at my wit’s end when Lord Crockinghorse, my
secretary, bobbed up with an idea. He’d had it on
ice for some time, it appeared. He produced a whiskery
blighter who opened oysters in a fried-fish shop;
the fellow smelled most evilly of shellfish, but he
looked exactly like me. In my condition at that time
I could hardly tell him from myself. Crockinghorse
coolly proposed that the whiskery oysterman should
take my place. I was shocked inexpressibly. An
oysterman substituting for a king! What a devastating
and yet absurd thought! I felt just as you do
now, Ernie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king blew a smoke ring and continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Crockinghorse won his point, and we dressed
up the whiskery blighter in my most garish uniform,
told him if he said a syllable more than ‘yes’ or ‘no’
we’d murder him, and taught him a speech which
went:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My loyal subjects [pause for cheers] I am overcome
by this reception. [Pause.] I can only say
thank you, thank you, thank you.’ We packed him
off in my pea-green uniform and next day the papers
all said, ‘His Majesty performed his part in the ceremony
with exceptional grace and dignity.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prince in his bed moaned; the king, with a
shrug, continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I was all cut up for days! Felt deucedly unnecessary.
But at last light dawned and the more I
thought of the whole affair the more it entertained
me. I ended by hiring the whiskery blighter at twenty-five
goobecs a week, gave him a room in the palace
near the kitchen and a lot of oysters to amuse himself
with and whenever I got tired of kinging I trotted
to Paris or somewhere incog and left the corner stone
laying to my oyster friend. He became rather better
at it than I. Oh, I had to do it, Ernie! If I hadn’t
had a genuine vacation now and then I should have got
squirrels in the cupola, absolutely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prince had aged perceptibly during this recital.
His voice quavered as he asked, “And where is the
fellow now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I still use him,” answered the king. “Only
last week I sent him down to Wizzelborough to lay
the corner stone of the new cathedral. You were
there, Ernie. Didn’t you notice anything peculiar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prince’s reply was faint-voiced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did notice that the cathedral smelled uncommonly
oystery,” he said. He drew in his breath; his
manner was that of a drowning man making a last
desperate effort to save himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” he said, “I am crushed by what you tell
me. I can’t believe that what you say is true of all
royal persons. Something in here”—the prince laid
a manicured hand on the spot on the bosom of his
lavender pajamas where he believed his heart to be—“tells
me that there are still kings who respect the traditions
of royalty, who are themselves and nothing
else. I appeal to Your Zabonian Serenity to reassure
me about this, to give me back my faith in myself and
my position. They wouldn’t do a thing like this in
Zabonia! Oh, tell me they wouldn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Emperor of Zabonia tossed away his scented
cigaret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You gentlemen,” he said in his slow, thick voice,
“have confided in me. I’m going to return the compliment.
I am not the Emperor of Zabonia. I’m just
an old actor from the Imperial Stock Company who
happens to look like the emperor. He is usually too
tight to go to public functions or pay royal visits, so
he sends me.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning the young prince pulled a velvet
bell cord and his valet entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thursday,” said the prince, “I’m supposed to
ride through the city and be pelted with flowers. It’s
an old tradition or some such rot. Will you please
take that dummy there in the corner, dress him in my
uniform as Honorary Rear Admiral of the Royal Submarine
Fleet, seat him in the royal carriage and drive
him around in my place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The valet bowed. The prince picked up the morning
newspaper and turned to the sporting page.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch9'>THE BATTLE OF WASHINGTON SQUARE</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>E wore no collar. If he had, it would have
been size 13½. He didn’t, because collars
cost twenty cents. Twenty cents paid his overhead
expenses for a day: two meals of stew and coffee at
Emil’s Busy Bee Lunchery—music by the Elevated
trains—and enough tobacco to make fifty cigarets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His collarlessness did not worry him; he gave it
no more thought than he gave to the art of poetry,
the influence of Confucius on China, or his country’s
foreign policy, if any. How to get that daily twenty
cents—that was what concerned him; that done, he
let his brain rest, wrapped in a hazy blanket. Leaning
against the wall of Hyde’s Stable in West Houston
Street, outside in summer, inside in winter, he accepted
the universe. Blue smoke, seeping from time
to time from his nostrils, was the only sign that he
had not mummified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His name was Joey Pell. He was nineteen years
old. As a baby he had had rickets, and as a result he
was bowlegged and undersized. His complexion was
imperfect. Of the six children born to his parents, he
was the last and the only one to survive the hazards of
infancy in a two-room flat on Hudson Street. His
mother sometimes said that this was enough to drive
a person to drink. Her husband, a truckman chronically
on strike, would remark, by way of repartee,
that it was quite unnecessary to drive her to drink.
She would reply, in part, that his own record as a
teetotaler was not unimpeachable. At this point in the
conflict little Joey knew it to be an act of prudence
to slip out of the room that served as kitchen, living
room and his bedroom. He was a timid, easily
frightened child, and had apparently inherited none
of his parents’ bellicose corpuscles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day he went out and never came back, and his
parents thereafter quarreled in peace, while he attached
himself to the stable as an unofficial valet and
general assistant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was afraid of horses, and he never conquered
that fear entirely, but the stable was warm, and the
men gave him dimes for helping with the harness, so
he stayed there; his was not a soul for high adventure.
They let him hang about the stable because he tried to
be useful. There was only one sort of job he’d balk
at—he would not go near mules. Of mules he stood
in deathly fear, for when he was six he had seen a man
trampled to death by an angry mule, and the look of
fright that had come to Joey’s face on that occasion
had never entirely left it. His haddock-like, watery
blue-gray eyes were still slightly apprehensive; his
lips always seemed on the verge of a quiver. When
he approached a person he sidled. He seemed to
expect to be kicked, and not infrequently he was.
When someone kicked him Joey Pell did not kick
back. He just melted away from the vicinity of the
kicker, with a look, hurt, and yet resigned, as if a
certain amount of kicking were his lot in life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He harbored no grudges and hated no one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For one thing, his memory was not good enough for
him to be a good hater; and, besides, it took venom
and energy to hate, and he had neither. His lack
of pugnacity barred him from the society of the other
boys of that part of the city, for they all aspired to be
pugilists or, failing that, competent members of the
Hudson Dusters, the Whyo Boys, the Gophers, or
other gangs; their evenings were full of fisticuffs.
Joey would have liked to be one of them, but, since
they did not appear to want him, he accepted the fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey Pell had learned to read much later than the
other boys, and reading was still somewhat of a labor
for him. He rarely got beyond the comic strips in
the newspapers; these he pored over with knit and
sober brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What went on in the world outside his stable mattered
little to him. Kings might be hurled into the
dust, the dogs of war might growl and gnaw their
leashes, black calamity might threaten the land—it
was all one to Joey Pell. His stew, his coffee, his
tobacco, his sleep—these filled his brain; it was not
a large one, and he had room for little else. It may
have been that the rumbling of events in the world
reached his ear, but they never penetrated into his
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men in the stable had been growing more and
more excited about something—a war of some sort,
Joey concluded. It was much too remote an affair
to concern him, anyhow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, one day, something exciting happened to
Joey Pell. He received a letter. It was the first letter
he had ever received in his life, and he stood in front
of the stable, fingering it gingerly with dirty hands.
He was a little alarmed. Why should anyone write
to him? Probably it was a mistake. He stared at the
address again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Himself beyond question. He wondered what he
had done. He tore open the envelope and pored over
the printed letter inside. He wondered why he should
be called upon to present himself at a certain place
and time. The letter confused him. So he took it to
Phil Hyde, who owned the stable. Hyde glanced at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they got you,” Hyde said with a grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah—you gotta fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me fight? Fight who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, stupid, don’t you know there’s a war on?
This here means you’re drafted.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Joey liked camp. For the first week he was in a
daze; the officers who examined him seemed blurred
and enormous. He was lanced by a fear that he must
immediately shed blood, or have his own shed. It
seemed a poor choice to Joey Pell. When he found
that the day he must engage in actual combat was
remote he began to enjoy the military life. Never
before had he been so well fed, had he had such a
clean, warm place to sleep, had he had such trim new
clothes. He realized this, and he did what he was
told to do, whole-heartedly; he was afraid that he
might be put out of the Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The regular life suited him. It was pleasant to
have someone else do all the thinking. He liked to do
things by the numbers—one, two, three, four. He
liked to march along, hep, hep, hep, hep, in step,
shoulder to shoulder with the other soldiers. He belonged
with them; they were his gang; it was a fine
new feeling. They accepted him as one of them. He
began to take trouble about his hair and finger nails,
to take an interest in baths. His chest grew an inch,
his biceps grew firmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey Pell learned many things at camp. One of
them was bayonet fighting. At first it made him tremble
and turn sick inside; but he got over that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, you, with the pasty face!” the sergeant
barked. “Put some life into it. It’ll make a man of
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey tried to do so. But he found it hard to be enthusiastic
about stabbing even a dummy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get mad!” roared the sergeant. “Hate ’em!
Drive it into their guts! Curse ’em as you thrust.
Give it to ’em—one, two, three!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey was a good soldier; he was told to hate; he
hated. He learned to drive the keen point of his
bayonet into the straw intestines of the dummies; as he
did so he gritted his teeth and sharply cursed. He
came to hate each of the dummies with a personal
hate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other soldiers in his squad did not talk much
about the war. Mostly they talked of girls, and baseball,
and prize fighting, and the bartenders they knew,
and of what the lieutenant said to them and their own
daring retorts to him. Sometimes, in sentimental moments,
they showed one another pictures of wives,
sweethearts or babies. When they did talk of the war
they cursed the men they were to fight against, and
told stories of their savagery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Joey listened he felt inside very much as he had
felt that day when he saw the mule trampling the
life from a man. His fear bred hate. These people
were devils; it was a virtue to hate them, a good deed
to kill them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grim monsters peopled his dreams. They were in
gray, and were twice the size of ordinary men, and
fiendish of face. In his dreams he fought them. As
they bore down on him he drove his bayonet into
their throats. The sergeant had no occasion to criticize
his bayonet drill now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey Pell was a one-idea man. Once his mind had
been filled to capacity with the problem of keeping
alive; now that problem was happily solved for him;
so he had space for another idea. That idea was to
be a good soldier, and, it followed, a sincere hater of
the enemy. This became Joey’s obsession. He won
an approving grunt from the sergeant by the ferocity
of his attack in the bayonet drill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another fine new feeling came to Joey Pell on his
first leave of absence in New York City. He realized
that he was a hero. He saw that he was a person of
importance. His had been a life without color, a
humble life. Back in the stable he was less important
than one of the horses; not the faintest beam of
limelight had ever fallen on his small figure in that
manure-scented obscurity. Men had treated him
curtly; no woman had ever smiled at him. He had
been unwanted. But now it was different. He was a
soldier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had taken the three days’ leave of absence because
his turn had come, not because he wanted it;
he’d no idea what use he could make of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was trudging along Fifth Avenue, bound for
his stable below Washington Square, when he heard
a voice calling, “Oh, soldier boy! Oh, soldier boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked about; there was no other soldier in
sight; so the lady in the limousine must be calling to
him. Her car had come quite close to the curb; it
was a magnificent car, huge and glittering with
polished nickel. Inside, it was heavily upholstered,
and so was the richly dressed lady who sat there, and
who had called to Joey. She was smiling. Joey eyed
her suspiciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t I take you where you are going?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t goin’ nowhere,” he mumbled. He felt suddenly
hot, awkward, conscious of his complexion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, then let me take you to the Home Trench,”
said the lady. Joey looked dubious; he wondered
what her game was. “Don’t you know about the
Home Trench?” she asked. Her voice partly reassured
him. “It’s for soldier boys like you. It’s in
my own house on Fifth Avenue. I’m Mrs. J. Goodhue
Wilmerding, you know. Come, get in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held open the limousine’s door invitingly. Joey
stumbled in. He sat, uncomfortable, bolt upright on
the edge of the fat seat. The roses in the silver vase
overawed him; he associated flowers only with funerals.
From the corner of his eye he watched the lady.
Perhaps, he thought, she was a spy who would try
by honeyed words to get important military information
from him. He resolved to kick her roundly in
the shins and leap from the car if she tried any funny
business on him, Private Joseph Pell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is just wonderful,” he heard her say, “of you
boys to do what you are doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m,” said Joey Pell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, if I were only a man”—she expelled a sigh—“but,
since I’m not, I’m doing my bit as best I can.
Last week at the Home Trench we entertained seven
hundred and sixty-one soldier boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m,” said Joey Pell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you’ll like the Home Trench,” she went
on. “All the waitresses there are Junior League girls.
They dance with the boys.” Then she added, “With
all the boys. Isn’t it wonderful how this terrible war
has brought us all closer together?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m,” said Joey Pell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” she said, “if you know my son at your
camp—Major Sears Wilmerding, on the general’s
staff?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No’m,” said Joey Pell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must introduce yourself to him when you go
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m,” said Joey Pell, with mental reservations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, I consider all soldier boys my sons,”
she said. “Ah, here we are—at the Home Trench.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The motor car purred up to the curb before an
opulent brownstone house on lower Fifth Avenue.
Over the door was a sign, decorated with flags:</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>The Home Trench</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>All Soldiers Welcome</span></p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Joey followed Mrs. Wilmerding into the house.
Inside, a pretty girl pounced on Joey, asked his name,
and pinned a tag on his coat bearing the words “I am
Private Pell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blinking, he stepped from the hallway into the
large front room. It was filled with soldiers and
girls. In one corner a phonograph was grinding out
brassily “Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit
Bag, and Smile, Smile, Smile.” Some of the girls
and soldiers were dancing—the soldiers for the most
part stiff and self-conscious, the girls bright-eyed and
putting much spirit into the task of making the soldiers
enjoy themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little bobbed-haired girl captured Joey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Peggy Sturgis,” she announced, taking his
hand, which hung limply by his side, and shaking it
violently. “You’re Private Pell, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey gulped, and nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know some Pells at Tuxedo Park,” she said.
“Are you one of them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No’m,” said Joey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we dance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was too overwhelmed by this entirely novel experience
to refuse. She towed and hauled and steered
him about the crowded room, while the phonograph
did its best with “Over There.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” she said, “it’s just wonderful of you
boys to do what you are doing.” Joey flushed. “I
wish,” she said wistfully, “that I were a man. I’d be
in the cavalry. Don’t you just adore horses, Mr.
Pell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey licked dry lips and nodded. He hated horses,
as a matter of fact; but she had called him Mister, and
that was another new and stimulating experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other girls danced with Joey Pell that day. They
told him, every one of them, how brave a thing he was
doing. He drank a great deal of not very sweet
lemonade, and only when the Home Trench closed for
the day, at six o’clock, did he leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was almost as much intoxicated as if the
lemonade had been champagne, as he strode up the
avenue, chin out, eyes narrowed sternly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wished earnestly that he might meet one of
the enemy face to face at that moment. He felt
capable of laying him low, barehanded. He saluted
all officers with a sharp precise salute; he even saluted
a passing letter carrier. His heart beat with unwonted
vigor; he was a soldier; a somebody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He surveyed suspiciously each passerby in the
hope that he might discover a spy. He found no spy,
but he did find an elderly gentleman who gave him
a theater ticket, and a blessing. Joey took the
ticket without embarrassment; he was getting used
to gifts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he marched along he saw a sign:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Free Chow for the Lads in Khaki</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>He entered the big brick building and was greeted
by an aroma of disinfectant, liniment and athletes,
and by a plump enthusiastic man, who slapped Joey
on the shoulder and cried jovially, “Howdy, buddy!
Greetings! Come right in and get your chow. Afterwards
we’re going to have a get-together and sing.
You’ll stay, of course.” He patted Joey’s shoulder
with a big-brother gesture. “You sure are lucky to
be in the Army,” said the plump man. “It’s mighty
fine, the spirit you boys are showing. I wish I could
be in khaki, but these darn flat feet of mine——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waved an apologetic pink hand toward his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the dining-room Joey ate copiously of beans,
cocoa and pie. He stayed a while for the singing,
and even added a cracked and unpractised tenor to
the chorus, which, led by the plump man with the
unfortunate feet, sang “Onward, Christian Soldiers,”
“K-K-Katy,” and “Hail, Hail, the Gang’s All Here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey slipped away and went to the theater. A war
play was being given—a moving piece with blank
cartridge battles and air raids offstage, and a whole
corps of villains in the persons of enemy officers,
cold sneering devils with spiked mustachios and evil
habits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey hissed them loudly. He was so carried away
indeed, that at one critical juncture in the play he
contemplated swarming over the footlights and doing
violence to the chief villain, a fiend in human form if
ever there was one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was diverted from this by an opportunity closer
at hand. Between acts a speaker urged the audience
to buy bonds to support the war. The speaker was
eloquent, and he pointed dramatically at Joey, who
sat in the fifth row.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boys like him,” said the speaker, “are giving their
lives for you. Will you not give your dollars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey blushed with a happy pride; the eyes of the
house were on him. Pretty girls passed subscription
blanks. The man in front of Joey did not take one.
He was a stumpy man with a round bristly head;
Joey had had his suspicions of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a slacker,” the girl with the blanks said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I em nod a slecker,” returned the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was guttural; the enemy officers on the
stage talked in that same tone, Joey had observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Joey his duty was plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned forward and hissed into the man’s ear,
“You buy one of dem, see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man looked around; his face was purplish and
obstinate. He glared at Joey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I vill nod,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Joey saw his simple duty; he punched the
man squarely on his bulb of nose. The man punched
back, but a dozen fists descended on him from all
sides and he was hustled up the aisle by the ushers.
As he passed, members of the audience took kicks at
him. Joey was left in possession of the field. He
glowed. On the way out, several men, strangers,
shook hands with him; one man gave him a box of
cigarets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey Pell returned to camp in high spirits. The
wandering, furtive, foggy look of his stable days was
gone from his face; the droop was gone from his
spine. He had found himself; he was a soldier, a
person to be admired, respected, and even feared a
little. In his dreams he, single-handed, held the
breach against a prodigious number of the enemy.
They charged upon him, but he, though bleeding from
a dozen wounds, did not retreat. He held them back;
with rifle, bombs, bayonet, even fists, he hurled them
back until he was ringed round by piles of the slain.
The enemy fell back at last before his fury. Then
came the general, who pinned a large medal on Joey’s
chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a man,” said the general, “and a soldier.
Give me your hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey saluted, then fainted. In some dreams he
never recovered; he was given a military funeral of
considerable pomp. He even saw his tombstone, with
the words carved on it:</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='it'>PRIVATE JOSEPH PELL</span></span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='it'>He Died for His Flag</span></p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He saw Mrs. J. Goodhue Wilmerding, in black,
sobbing. He saw Peggy Sturgis, inconsolable. He
saw the pretty girls at the Home Trench in tears. He
even saw the plump man with the traitorous feet turn
his head away to hide his emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In most of his dreams, however, he permitted himself
to survive; badly wounded, of course. He saw
himself nursed back to health by Peggy Sturgis, under
the solicitous maternal eye of Mrs. Wilmerding. He
saw himself given a good job by a grateful Government—something
with a large salary and not much
work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He contrived to go to New York often. He invented
sick sisters, dying mothers, important business
of a private nature. He would step out into the rattling
rush of the city with the tread of a conquerer. He
liked the friendly, approving glances that were cast
on him. His appetite for deference grew keen. It
was an enormously fine feeling to swing with military
step and carriage up Fifth Avenue on a crisp day,
uniform pressed, shoes shined, and with campaign
hat rakishly shading eyes that managed to look grim,
warlike and noble all at the same time, and yet did
not miss a single sign of interest or sympathy in a
single passing face. It was a never-ending source of
delight to Joey Pell that he could step to the curb
and signal any of the handsome motor cars that were
passing, and have the car stop for him, and be treated
as an honored guest by the occupant and be driven
wherever he wished to go. It was pleasant to know
that he could not walk two blocks without having
some well-dressed person stop his motor car and invite
Joey to have a ride. He spent whole days being taken
up Fifth Avenue and then back again. He got so that
he accepted offers only from the most expensive cars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Always he found a ready welcome at the Home
Trench. Mrs. Wilmerding was so gracious, and
Peggy Sturgis so interested and so eager that he should
feel at home. And there were many other places
that opened their doors to him—clubs and rest rooms
and private homes. He was called “buddy,” and told
many times how proud everyone was of him; he was,
indeed, not a little proud of himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was attacked by an urgent desire to live up to
what was expected of him, to be a hero in reality, to
win medals, to do violence to the enemy; his hate,
daily more bitter, demanded an outlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began to ask the sergeants, “When do we go
across?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They did not know, so they looked mysterious. He
began to be worried; he had a fear that the war might
be over before he could get into it. He even ventured
to ask the captain when the regiment would sail.
The captain, who did not know, looked mysterious.
Joey’s worry increased. His dreams became haunted
by visions of an early peace or by the specter of himself
being left behind when his regiment did, at last,
sail. Why didn’t it sail? Surely he was ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day toward which all Joey Pell’s thoughts had
turned did come. The sergeants looked more mysterious
than usual; the officers whispered together and
looked very wise. At retreat the captain announced
the news with a suitable gravity; Joey quivered from
the peak of his campaign hat to the nail-studded soles
of his army shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The regiment sails from Hoboken May fifth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all his life Joey Pell had never heard more exciting,
more gratifying words. May fifth was but six
days distant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey cajoled a one-day pass to New York from the
top sergeant. It was one of the brightest days he had
ever known. Everyone was so kind to him. At the
Home Trench they were especially nice to him; Mrs.
Wilmerding had him to dinner in her own dining-room,
and they had turkey. To Joey for anyone to
have turkey at any time but Christmas was unheard-of
luxury; it made him surer than ever that he was
a personage. They all wrung his hand when at last,
reluctantly, he left, bearing a load of wristlets,
sweaters, trench mirrors, candy and cigarets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night before he was to sail Joey Pell did not
sleep at all. He lay watching his equipment; now
and then he examined it to see if it was all there and
in perfect order; he did not want to take the most minute
chance or to risk in any way being left behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in M Company, which was to go aboard the
transport last. He sat on the chilly pier, chafing. He
wanted to get under way; he could not be sure he was
actually going until the Statue of Liberty faded from
view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard a sergeant’s staccato order: “Detail—Privates
Leary, Kochanski, Pell——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sprang up and stood at attention with the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go aboard,” the sergeant ordered, “and feed the
mules.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey held back when he reached the hold where
the artillery mules were; they were restless and were
scuffling and biting in the half darkness. He decided
that he had done his duty in bringing the pails of
water that far; others could give them to the mules.
But a watchful corporal spied him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, you!” shouted the corporal. “Water them
mules.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But still Joey held back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, you ain’t afraid of them, are you?” demanded
the corporal scornfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naw,” said Joey, “not exactly, but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be yella!” shot out the corporal. “Are
you a soldier or ain’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey picked up the pails resolutely; decidedly he
was a soldier. He shouldered his way in among the
mules; they seemed gigantic, grotesque in the dimness.
He set down one of the pails. It was then that
a mule lashed out with its steel-shod hoof. It hit
Joey Pell squarely in the back of the head. Sharply
a swift blackness fell on his brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the military hospital in a deserted department
store on lower Sixth Avenue, to which they rushed
Joey Pell, the doctors said that his skull was crushed
and that part of it was pressing on his brain. His
regiment sailed without him; but Joey Pell never
knew it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His was a curious case, the doctors said. They
were able to relieve some of the pressure on his
brain, but not all of it. He continued to exist. But
he existed as a vegetable does. The part of his brain
that gave him memory did not work at all. He had
no past, no yesterdays. Each day when he woke, it
was as if he were freshly born. Certain habits remained—eating,
dressing, simple motion. But he
was quite unsensitive to impressions. Each day they
told him his name, and a moment later he forgot it.
He never asked how he happened to be there; he never
asked about anything; he simply sat in the corner of
the private room they had given him, quiet, apathetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For two years the brain of Private Joseph Pell lay
fallow. His mind simply closed up shop and went on
a vacation. So, while he sat there, impervious to
anything, in a perfect vacuum, his regiment fought,
the Armistice was signed, his regiment returned, there
was a triumphal march up Fifth Avenue, the regiment
was demobilized, and the great city swallowed
it once more. The soldiers who had been clerks returned
to their counters, the soldiers who had been
truckmen returned to their trucks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was May fifth, two years after Joey Pell’s accident.
The attendant on duty near Joey’s room had
gone to the floor below to play cards with another
attendant. Joey Pell in his chair grew sleepy in the
drowsy spring morning air. His head nodded forward
on the bosom of his hospital nightshirt. He fell
asleep. A fire engine bellowing past in the street below
screamed with its siren under his window. The
impact of the sound startled him awake. It jerked
him upright in his chair; the sudden movement tipped
the chair over and Joey Pell pitched backward to the
floor; his head struck violently a sharp corner of his
iron bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lay for a moment where he had fallen; then
slowly he pulled himself to his feet and stared, puzzled,
about him. What was he, Private Joseph Pell,
doing in this room on the day his regiment was to sail
for the Front? Then he remembered; they had made
him go among the mules; one of the mules must have
kicked him and stunned him; certainly his head still
buzzed; the fools had carted him to this hospital,
thinking he was badly hurt; as if a kick in the head
could hurt a soldier! Decisively Joey Pell tore the
nightshirt from his body. His regiment was going
to sail that day at noon, and he was going to sail with
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw that he must act swiftly, but with caution.
In the next ward soldiers were drowsing. Their uniforms
hung on pegs by their beds. Joey commandeered
the first uniform he came to; its owner was
asleep. He was a very much bigger man than Joey,
and the uniform was half a dozen sizes too large, so
that it draped around Joey’s meager frame in great
folds. The purloined shoes were elevens, and Joey
customarily wore fives. The hat came down over his
ears; no matter; once aboard the transport, Joey knew
he could get a new outfit. He hunted feverishly for his
pack and his rifle. He could find no pack, but in a
storeroom he did find a rifle. It was not his, for it
was rusty and dusty, and his own was always clean
and well cared for. He took it anyhow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had seen a clock, and saw that it was ten. He
had two hours to get to Hoboken. He had no idea
where he was and his knowledge of geography was
limited, so he was not at all certain where Hoboken
was; in Jersey, somewhere, he fancied. He slipped
out of the hospital; his idea was to find the Hudson
River and get a ferry. He saw from the street signs
that he was at Sixth Avenue and Eighteenth Street;
he breathed a sigh of relief. His problem was simple;
he had only to hail a passing motor car and ask
its driver to take him to one of the downtown ferries.
He turned toward Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man was coming along the street toward Joey.
He was a well-dressed man, and he was escorting an
appreciable paunch. Joey smiled at him; the man
scowled and increased his pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey reached Fifth Avenue. People were hurrying
along. They did not smile at Joey Pell; they hardly
glanced at him; when they did, it was with scant interest
and no friendliness. He wondered about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A big motor car cruised slowly past; there was a
lady in white summer furs in the back seat, and there
were orchids in the silver vase. Joey held up his hand
as a signal for the car to stop. The lady looked at
him obliquely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give us a lift,” called Joey Pell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady leaned forward and said something to the
chauffeur; the car jumped ahead and sailed at a
swifter rate of speed down the Avenue. Joey looked
after it; he scratched his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He signaled another car; it did not stop. He signaled
another; it did not stop. He signaled others;
none of them paid the least heed to him. He stood,
perplexed, on the corner. Something hard prodded
him in the ribs; it was the night stick of a policeman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Move along there, Jack,” ordered the policeman.
“I been watchin’ you. If you wanna panhandle, go
over on Broadway; Fifth Avenue is closed, see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But——” sputtered Joey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t give me no argument,” said the policeman
sternly. “Beat it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave Joey another prod with his club. Joey
moved down Fifth Avenue; he was a little giddy. He
wished he had time to show that big stiff of a cop
that he could not talk to a soldier that way, but time
was going fast, and his regiment sailed at noon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey Pell hurried along. He had no time to speculate
about why no one smiled at him. He had an
idea, and that was to go to the Home Trench, which
was near Eleventh Street; Mrs. Wilmerding always
had a car or two on hand; a word to her, and he’d be
driven to Hoboken at top speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ran up the steps of her stately house. Someone
had taken down the Home Trench sign, he noticed.
He tried to open the door, but it was locked. That
was odd, he thought; it had always been open from
eight till six. It must be stuck, he thought. So he
pressed the bell. A jowlish man with side bars came
to the door and surveyed Joey in his tentlike uniform
coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” inquired the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey started to enter, but the man barred the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you going?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goin’ in,” said Joey. “Wanna see Mrs. Wilmerding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have to be announced,” the man stated.
“What are your name and business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—er”—Joey stammered—“just tell her it’s
Joey Pell—Private Pell. She knows me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait here,” said the man, and he closed the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey Pell waited. It was all very strange, he
thought. He could look in through the window and
see the long front room; usually it was crowded with
soldiers; this day it was empty; not quite empty,
however. At a desk sat a well-nourished lady—Mrs.
Wilmerding, unquestionably. Joey Pell felt greatly
relieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened a trifle. The side-barred man was
there. “Mrs. Wilmerding is not at home,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey decided that the man was joking; that this
was a new system of entertainment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, kid,” he said, “you ain’t looked very hard.
I can see her right in there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s not at home,” said the man; his voice was
frigid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, cut the kiddin’,” said Joey. “My reg’ment
sails at noon and I gotta get to Hoboken.” The butler
appeared to be closing the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, Mrs. Wilmerding! Mrs. Wilmerding!” Joey
called loudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came out from her drawing room; her face
was unsmiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jeffords,” she said to the butler, “what does he
want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told him you were not at home, madam,” the
butler said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Wilmerding,” broke in Joey, “I gotta get to
Hoboken—quick—see?—and I thought you could
help me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I advise you to apply to the Veteran’s Charity
Bureau, in Madison Avenue,” she said, and shut the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joey stood on the steps for two precious minutes.
He wondered what he had done to offend her. But he
knew he had no time to puzzle it out. He again
started down the Avenue. And again he noticed that
the faces of those who passed him were uninterested,
without friendliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the sea of faces swam a familiar one—Peggy
Sturgis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saluted her and said, “Hello, Miss Sturgis.
Well, I’m off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not return his salutation; she looked at him
queerly, as if there were something curious about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say—you ain’t forgot me already?” blurted Joey
Pell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” she said coolly, “but I’m afraid I
have. One met so many soldiers you know. I hope
things are going well with you. Goodby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was gone before he could catch his breath.
What terrible thing had he done, he wondered. But
he had no room in his mind for much wondering; his
immediate problem was to get to Hoboken by noon.
He pushed on toward Washington Square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he progressed along, at a half run, he overtook
two men who were also going toward the square. Joey
saw that they, too, were in uniform—but it was not
khaki; it was a garish uniform, strange to him. He
stopped short. But it was not the uniforms of the
men that stopped him; it was their talk. They were
talking in the language of the enemy. Joey Pell had
learned to recognize it. Joey knew at once that they
must be spies. He slackened his pace and followed
close behind them. Fear hit him. If he captured the
men he’d miss the transport. But it was his duty, he
saw that, to capture them; he would do his duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across the broad square he followed the two men.
They headed for a crowd assembled in the southeast
corner of the square. Joey did not take his eyes off
them till they neared the crowd. Then he looked up,
and his heart turned a somersault. His fingers closed
tight on his rifle. The crowd was forming in a military
formation, and they all wore the same strange
garish uniforms as the two spies; and furthermore,
they were speaking the same language. Joey stopped
and stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The uniformed men carried a banner; it bore words
in a foreign language. The truth came to Joey Pell in
a sickening flash: the enemy had captured New York!
How or when, he did not know. But there they were;
they held Washington Square. He watched them,
petrified with horror and hate. He tried to decipher
their flag, but it meant nothing to him. He could not
read its inscription:</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>Young Men’s Uniformed</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>Gymnastic and Singing</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>Society of the Reformed</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>Lutheran Church</span></p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He could not tell from their speech that they were
assembling to march to the funeral of a deceased
member. One thought filled his brain: the enemy
had captured New York. Now he understood why the
people had ignored him; they were afraid to do
otherwise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hands tightened on his rifle; there was no
question what his duty was; they were two hundred
to one; but he was a soldier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fumbled at his belt for cartridges, then groaned
as he realized he had none. Crouching behind a
tree he drew from its scabbard the bayonet; his
teeth bit into each other as he fixed the bayonet
in its socket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he jumped from behind his tree. His voice,
high and shrill, sounded through the square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll show you, you devils; I’ll show you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The surprised members of the uniformed gymnastic
and singing society saw his fantastic figure come running
toward them. At first they thought he was
joking. Then, when they saw the leveled bayonet,
they thought him crazy. Straight into the midst of
them charged Private Joseph Pell. His big hat
came down over his eyes, so the lunge he made with
his bayonet at the chest of the leader of the society
missed its mark and the point became entangled in
the sleeve of that astonished young gymnast and
singer. The men were sure he was a madman now.
They knocked him down on the granite pavement;
Private Joseph Pell’s head hit one of the blocks.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>So ended the Battle of Washington Square, the
briefest battle in history, and yet the only one where
the American Army’s casualties were 100 per cent.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch10'>THE LAST OF THE FLATFEET</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>IS name was Ugobeecheebuggocheebeepawpawkeepiswiskiweeweechinoobee.
In Flatfoot Indian this means, of course,
Little-Big-Fat-Brown-Muskrat-Sitting-on-a-Pine-Stump-With-
His-Tail-just-Touching-the-Ground.
At the school on the
reservation whither he was taken, screaming, at a
tender age, the teacher, in the interest of simplicity
and patriotism, renamed him George Washington Ug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some months had passed, the teacher voiced a
regret that he had done this; it hardly seemed fair
to the Father of His Country. Closer acquaintance
with the young aborigine forced the teacher to conclude
that it was entirely unlikely that Ug would ever
be first in war, peace, or, indeed, anything. Privately
the teacher expressed the opinion that if Ug were to
unveil his boxlike head in the open air Ug would be
in acute peril from woodpeckers. The juvenile Ug
seemed absolutely impervious to the pearls of knowledge
with which he was pelted. So the teacher decided
to change his name to Walter Muskrat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then that the salient trait of Ug’s character
shone forth. He refused flatly to be Walter Muskrat.
Somehow the idea had seeped through some chink
in his cranium that George Washington was, or had
been, a great white chief entitled to many feathers
and rich in horses, squaws and scalps, for whom it
was an honor to be named. Ug announced without
passion but with palpable determination that he intended
to remain George Washington Ug. What was
his, was his, he intimated. Arguments, cajolery,
threats left him equally unmoved. He refused to
answer to any other name, and he refused to eat.
Before his wooden-faced obduracy the teacher at
length surrendered; Ug remained George Washington
Ug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the task of civilizing Ug, the teacher, a zealous
soul, gave particular attention. It was a matter of
pride with that teacher that the civilizing job should
be a thorough one, neat, efficient, and with no rough
edges; for Ug, it seemed quite probable, was destined
to be the last of the Flatfeet. To civilize a Flatfoot!
That was an ambition worthy of any man, thought
the teacher. It had never been done; full well the
teacher knew this. Had he not been trying for thirty
years? He had seen no end of Flatfoot youths issue
forth from his schoolroom, to the outward eye finished
products, glowing with the high polish of civilization
and possessed of well-cultivated tastes for derby hats,
bank accounts, a reasonable amount of morality,
safety razors, hymns, suspenders, lawsuits and the
other essential habiliments of civilization, only to
backslide into barbarous practises at the first suitable
opportunity that presented itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a broad streak of atavism in the Flatfoot,”
said the teacher. “He reverts to type as easily
as the rattlesnake sheds its skin. On Saturday night
he may be seen in a derby hat and rah-rah clothes,
peaceably eating a nut sundae in a drug store and
discussing Ty Cobb, ship subsidies and self-starters
with the clerk. On the following Monday, like as
not, he is back in moccasins and feathers, doing some
forbidden tribal dance, whetting up his hunting
knife and wistfully regretting that the Government
has such narrow-minded prejudices against a little
scalping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” concluded the teacher, “I’ve got hold of Ug
early enough to civilize him so it will stick. The last
of the Flatfeet is going to be the best of the Flatfeet.
I’ll train Ug so that he will never want to take
off his derby hat. After all, the derby hat is the
symbol of civilization. No man can possibly be wild
in a derby hat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he labored over Ug. Time passed, as it is
apt to, and Ug’s chest measurement and appetite increased,
and the teacher watched hopefully for signs
of mental and moral development. That Ug would
ever become a profound thinker, the teacher harbored
grave doubts; there was scant indication that the
chunky, square-faced boy would ever become a Flatfoot
Aristotle. Indeed, in darker moments the teacher
sometimes opined that the only way to implant seeds
of knowledge in that brown head was by means of a
major operation involving trepanning. It was not
that Ug preferred sin to syntax; docilely enough, and
readily, he accepted the leading facts of an elementary
education—to wit: That in 1492 Columbus
sailed the ocean blue; that six times nine is invariably
fifty-four; that one must spell “separate” with an
“a” till one’s hair turns gray; that homicide is not
only illegal but unethical; that the femur is the longest
bone in the human body; that when a fat man gets
into a tubful of water the water will overflow. Having
accepted them, he forgot them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However,” said the teacher, “if I can teach him
to be a law-abiding member of his community, who
will work and keep sober, it will be enough. A man
can be civilized without being a mental Hercules.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He continued most earnestly to train Ug in the way,
by civilized canons, he should go. When Ug was
fourteen a most encouraging event happened. With
his own delighted eyes the teacher observed the behavior
of Ug that day at recess in the school yard
when Ug became involved in a quarrel with Henry
James Curly Bear, a sprig of the Blackfoot tribe,
and a youth of superior size and brawn. Henry
James Curly Bear, whom no amount of effort had
been able to redeem from savagery, had kicked Ug
roundly in a dispute over the somewhat knotty technical
problem of whether Jack Dempsey was a greater
fighter than Ty Cobb was a ball player. Ordinarily
such an act meant instant and spirited fistic battle,
for traditionally the Flatfeet are of martial cast and
care no more for Blackfeet than one male bulldog
cares for another male bulldog confined in the same
coal bin. The teacher made ready to launch himself
into the fray and drag the opponents apart. To
his surprise and joy he heard Ug say in ringing
tones:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not fight you, Henry James Curly Bear.
The teacher says only bad people fight. Good people
sue in the courts. If you kick me again, Henry
James Curly Bear, when I say my prayers tonight
I’ll tell our heavenly Father on you, and He’ll fix
you, Henry James Curly Bear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young Curly Bear expressed the opinion that Ug
was afraid of him. This Ug gently denied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Good Book,” said George Washington Ug,
“says that it is wicked to fight; and, anyhow, why
don’t you take somebody your own size?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, not without a show of dignity, Ug turned
his back on young Curly Bear and retired from the
scene. The teacher felt the warming flush of pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Score one for civilization,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he walked toward his home that evening the
teacher was decidedly in a self-congratulatory mood;
overnight, almost, it seemed that Ug had begun to
respond to the efforts of the teacher. With such
gratifying thoughts in his brain, the teacher passed
a grove of live oaks, a secluded spot. To his ears
came sounds. He stopped. Louder grew the sounds,
and stranger; they appeared to issue from the grove.
Now he heard a wail, shrill and laden with some
emotion akin to anger; then he heard a chant, weird,
almost frenzied. The teacher cautiously pushed aside
some underbrush and peered into the grove. An
unpedagogical expression leaped to his lips, for he
saw the person from whom the sounds came, and he
knew their import.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chanting lips were the lips of his pupil, George
Washington Ug. As Ug chanted he danced—a wild,
abandoned dance full of twists, turns, bends and
wriggles. Gone were Ug’s pants; they hung on a
stump; and so did his derby hat. In his black hair
stood feathers, plainly the tail feathers of a recently
despoiled rooster. In his hand gleamed the blade of
a jackknife, and he made menacing gestures at what
the teacher thought at first was a bit of red string
but which closer scrutiny revealed to be an adult
earthworm of the night-crawler variety. A concentrated
and bloodthirsty scowl was on the face of Ug
as he twisted in the dance, and chanted:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Koopeekis koopeekis</p>
<p class='line0'>Bobbochee cheebobo</p>
<p class='line0'>Toowanda bonda bonda bonda</p>
<p class='line0'>Bopokum kobokum.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>At this point Ug dispatched the earthworm by biting
off its head. Chagrin and horror overwhelmed
the watching teacher, for he knew that the chant
meant:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“Help me, O bloody war spirit, to strangle my enemy,
Curly Bear, even as I strangle this serpent. Give me the
strength to mash him, smash him, scalp him and cut him
into very small bits.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was the forbidden snake dance. By such
heathenish rites, the teacher knew, Flatfoot braves
in the unregenerate days of yore had whipped themselves
into a fury before going on the warpath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The teacher descended, outraged, on Ug, confiscated
the worm on the spot, and chastised Ug corporeally
on another spot. What, demanded the teacher, did
Ug mean by this? Ug, frightened, replied that he
didn’t know. Once, years and years before, when
he was little more than a papoose, he had seen his
father and the other men of the tribe do this dance
in a secret spot. He had not thought of it since;
but on this evening, as he was wandering past the
grove, smarting under the insults and kicks of Henry
James Curly Bear, an earthworm had crossed his
path; and suddenly, somehow, the idea had come to
him to do the dance. He could not explain why.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It just came over me, like, teacher, please,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night the teacher thought long over the problem
of civilizing Ug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must do more than make him accept the ways
of white men,” the teacher said. “I must make him
like them. But how? First, I must get hold of
his imagination. I must find the secret spring in
his nature to which he will respond with genuine
enthusiasm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The teacher was unlike many teachers in this: He
did not think that every little Indian was exactly
like every other little Indian. He set about the task
of prodding for Ug’s own particular secret spring. It
took days, but he found it at last. It was pride;
ardent patriotic pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mostly, when the teacher was talking of fractions
or verbs or such things, Ug was in a species of torpor,
with dull face. But when the teacher conducted the
class in history and civics and spoke of Uncle Sam,
Ug, the teacher noticed, straightened his backbone
and brightness came into his black eyes. The clue
was enough for the astute teacher. He dilated on
the power of Uncle Sam and his love for all in the
country, but particularly for his wards, the Indians,
and most particularly of all for a certain youthful
Flatfoot named George Washington Ug. Ug was impressed;
that was plain. He became passionately
devoted to Uncle Sam; he appeared to derive unlimited
comfort and inspiration from the fact that a
benevolent old gentleman in a tall gray hat, a star-spangled
vest, striped trousers and a goatee was his
friend and protector. Tho Ug’s notions of what
a ward is were slightly fogbound, he was very proud
of the fact that he was a ward of Uncle Sam. He
rather looked down on the white farmers whose land
adjoined the reservation; they were mere citizens; he
was a ward. No longer, when larger Indians kicked
him, did he plan to massacre them as they slept.
Instead, he said, “Just you wait! I’ll tell my Uncle
Sam on you some day when I see him.” And he
wrote down their names in a small note-book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the day that Ug discovered Uncle Sam he
became a changed Flatfoot. Gladly he embraced
the ways of the white man. “Uncle Sam won’t like
you if you don’t do this or that,” the teacher would
say; it would be enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No longer with reluctance did Ug wash his ears.
He attended church cheerfully; he brushed his derby
hat without being told; he contributed an occasional
penny to the missionary box; he learned empirically
that it is unwise to use the fingers in eating custard
and he desisted from doing so; he voluntarily
abandoned the notion of keeping a family of pet
skunks under his beds; he discontinued the practise of
putting grasshoppers down the necks of smaller Indians
during Sabbath school; he expressed at various
times ambitions to be a railroad engineer, a moving-picture
actor and a big-league shortstop; he told
lies only when it was necessary, and sometimes not
then. The teacher felt that Ug at last was headed
in the right direction; the last of the Flatfeet was
destined to be completely civilized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Ug was twenty the teacher decided that the
job was done. It was true that Ug’s scholarship was
still of dubious quality; he was still under the impression
that Utah is the capital of Omaha and that
six times six is forty-six. But his devotion to Uncle
Sam, his burning patriotism—they were unimpeachable.
Love of his country and its institutions was
in his blood; it broke out in a rash of small flags
in his coat lapels. Ug was given a diploma full
of curly penmanship, and a new derby hat, a gift
from a proud teacher, and sent forth into the world.
He was not worried about his future; Uncle Sam
would take care of him. Perhaps he’d raise pigs;
that seemed like a genteel occupation and one not
involving undue labor. Anyhow, whatever he did, if
he was a good Flatfoot, washed his ears regularly,
paid his bills, resisted any wayward impulses to
commit assault, battery, arson or theft, and in general
respected the edicts of his Uncle Sam’s representatives,
all would go well with him. He had, as one of
his most valued possessions, a newspaper picture
of the Atlantic Fleet riding the high seas; and, Ug
liked to reflect, at a word from him to his uncle, these
giant war canoes, with cannons as big as redwood
trees, would come chugging up the mountain streams
leading to the reservation to protect the rights of Ug
and strike terror to the hearts of Ug’s enemies. Of
course, Ug must merit this protection by leading an
unblemished life. This idea was the only thing
George Washington Ug carried away from the school
in addition to his diploma and his new derby hat;
but the teacher was satisfied that it was enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no doubt about it—Ug was a good Indian,
a credit to his teacher and an estimable member
of society. His room-and-a-half frame house on the
edge of the reservation he painted red, white and
blue. He bought a tin bathtub. He planted hollyhocks.
He carried a nail file in a leather case and
used it openly and unabashed at the gibes of the
less refined Indians. He refused to have dealings
with traffickers in illicit spirits; indeed, he obeyed
all rules, laws, ordinances and regulations punctiliously.
On the wall of his dwelling, opposite the rotogravure
of the Atlantic Fleet, was a large picture of
the Washington Monument, for the teacher, when
pressed, had told Ug that this was one of the homes
of his Uncle Sam. Ug had sent to himself from
Chicago a very civilized suit of blue serge with braid-bound
lapels and freckled with small pearl buttons.
He wore a rubber collar on Sundays, on formal calls
and on the Fourth of July, which he believed to be
Uncle Sam’s birthday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He even decided to shatter the best traditions of
the male Flatfoot and work a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work he selected for himself was of a sort in
keeping with the importance and social position of a
ward of Uncle Sam. George Washington Ug became
a model. He permitted himself to be photographed
by passing tourists, and for this privilege he charged
a dime. It was worth it. Ug was a perfect specimen
of Flatfoot beauty. His head had sharp corners, because
when he was a papoose it had been strapped
to a board, this being the Flatfoot contribution to the
science of child-rearing. His face was a mocha
prairie, with nostrils like gopher holes. He had eyes
like bits of new patent leather. In figure Ug was
inclined to plumpness; in general outline he resembled
a hot-water bag at high tide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was natural, as one of the fruits of civilization,
that Ug should aspire to be a capitalist. Accordingly
he saved his dimes and, after prayer and meditation,
invested them in a pig. It was not much of a pig,
and it was given to whimpering. Ug had no special
fondness for dumb animals, especially pigs; but he
kept his charge under his bed and waited for him
to increase and multiply. It was Ug’s hope and plan
that the pig would be the nucleus of a far-flung pig
ranch. After consulting his school history book Ug
named the animal General Grant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he left the pig to browse about in the chickweed
in the back yard and toughen its snout by trying
to root under the hog-tight fence, while Ug himself
added more dimes to his store by lurking in the
vicinity of the railroad station and displaying his
charms to the lenses of amateur photographers in
passing trains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lightning of calamity struck Ug one afternoon
at six minutes past five. Returning to his domicile,
Ug discovered that General Grant was not snuffling
about the back door, as was the General’s habit. That
the General could have burrowed under the fence
was impossible. So Ug searched the house. He
looked everywhere—under the bed, in the bathtub,
in the phonograph-record case. General Grant had
vanished. Ug retained enough hunting instinct to
look for tracks, and he found them. They were nail-shod
boot tracks and they pointed in the direction of
the farm of one Patrick Duffy, white farmer, just
across the boundary of the reservation. To him
went Ug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Duffy came out from his supper with egg on
his overalls and fire in his eye. He was a high,
wide, thick man, with a bushel of torch-colored hair,
a jaw like an iceberg and fists like demijohns. Ug
removed his derby hat, bowed, and inquired politely
if Mr. Duffy had seen a pig answering to the name of
General Grant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have,” said Mr. Duffy, grim of voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is he, please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In my pen,” responded Mr. Duffy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take him away,” said Ug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not,” said Mr. Duffy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he’s mine,” protested Ug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was,” corrected Mr. Duffy. “Now he’s mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since when, Patsy Duffy?” Ug was growing
agitated; he had heard tales of Mr. Duffy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your thievin’ pig,” declared Mr. Duffy, “come
over and et my prize parsnips. I was goin’ to show
’em at the state fair. They was worth eleven dollars—to
me, anyhow—not countin’ the honor an’
glory. Now they’re et. I’ll be keeping the pig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You give me back my pig, Patsy Duffy!” cried
Ug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You give me back my parsnips,” returned Mr.
Duffy coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But General Grant didn’t eat your parsnips,” said
Ug. “He hates parsnips. And, anyhow, he was home
all day. You took——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Injin,” said Mr. Duffy severely, “I
ain’t got time to stand out here debatin’ with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ug was trembling with an emotion he knew to
be sinful and contrary to all moral precepts. An
ax lay on a near-by woodpile, and Ug’s eyes leaped
from it to the bushy head of Patrick Duffy and then
back to the ax again; for a second, civilization tottered.
Then Ug, with a movement of resolution, replaced
the derby hat on his black locks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Patsy Duffy,” he said with dignity.
“Just you wait! I’m going to tell my uncle on you.”
And Ug turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can tell your aunt, too,” Mr. Duffy called
after him, “and all your cousins. But the pig stays
here, and if I ketch you pesterin’ around here, Injin,
I’ll boot you for a gool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ug made his way cabinward with cloudy brow.
Here was injustice, flagrant injustice. He was a
ward of Uncle Sam and he didn’t propose to be
treated like that, even by Patsy Duffy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not the pig; it’s the principle of the thing,”
muttered Ug as he tramped along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not that he was sentimentally attached to
General Grant; the pig, indeed, had grown to be
more of a pest than a pet. But the pig was his property,
and another man had dared to take him. Ug
shook his fist in the direction of the Duffy house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll rue the day, Patsy Duffy,” said Ug; he
had seen melodramas. Then Ug chuckled to himself.
He had reached the cabin and his eye had fallen on
the picture of the Atlantic Fleet; he was picturing to
himself Patsy Duffy shelled into submission by its
big guns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To his teacher, as the nearest representative of
Uncle Sam, Ug went and stated the case of the kidnaped
General Grant. The teacher listened sympathetically,
but he shook his gray head; he knew Patsy
Duffy, his gusty temper, his heavy fist, his plethoric
bank roll, his political power. He pointed out to
Ug that the recovering of kidnaped pigs was not a
pedagogical function; furthermore, Ug was no longer
a schoolboy, but a man of the world. Ug suggested
a direct appeal to Uncle Sam. The teacher said emphatically
that that would never do. Uncle Sam
was much too busy to be bothered about one pig. He
never, the teacher assured Ug, concerned himself
personally with any matter involving less than a
million pigs; his hired men looked after lesser cases,
the teacher said, congratulating himself secretly that
“hired men” was a rather good stroke. The law, suggested
the teacher, was on Ug’s side; his best advice
to Ug was to consult the law in the person of Marcellus
Q. Wigmore, attorney and counselor, in his
office in Timberlake City. Yes, that was the civilized
thing to do. Uncle Sam would approve; yes, yes,
consult the law by all means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ug, a shade disappointed but not at all downhearted,
greased his hair, dusted off his derby and
walked the sixteen miles to Timberlake City. The
majesty of the law, as embodied in Attorney and
Counselor Wigmore, was enthroned in two cobwebby
back rooms over a hay-and-feed store on Main Street.
Ug was permitted to sit in the outer room until
he was impressed, and this did not take long, for
it was a musty, intimidating, legal-smelling place
lined with books of repealed statutes and reports of
drainage commissions, important-looking books with
bindings suffering from tetter. Then Ug was summoned
into the presence of Attorney Wigmore, a lean,
dusty man of prehistoric aspect, with a dazzling bald
head, an imposing frock coat and a collar like a
spite fence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pursed shrewd lips and said, “And in what
way may I have the honor of serving you, sir?” in
a solemn court-room voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ug, overawed, got out, “Patsy Duffy stole General
Grant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah?” said Mr. Wigmore. “Ah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said he et his parsnips,” hurried on Ug. “But
General Grant never et them. He hated parsnips—honest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said Mr. Wigmore, “an interesting historical
fact. But how, may I inquire, do the tastes of the
late general concern me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ug poured out his story of the abduction of his
pig. Mr. Wigmore said, to himself, “Patsy Duffy?
Ah, yes; ah, yes.” Then he addressed Ug, as if
he were a jury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear sir,” said Attorney and Counselor Wigmore
gravely, “this is indeed a pretty legal problem.
Hur-r-rumph! Yes, a pretty legal problem. I hesitate
to give an <span class='it'>ex-cathedra</span> opinion on a question involving
so moot a point of jurisprudence. Hur-r-rumph!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ug listened, confused but fascinated. The eyes
of Mr. Wigmore searched the grimy ceiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hur-r-rumph!” he said, with a bass judicial clearing
of the throat. “Let us put the case in its simplest
terms. We have you, the plaintiff, the party of the
first part; we have one Patrick Duffy, defendant, party
of the second part; we have one General Grant, pig,
<span class='it'>casus belli</span>, party of the third part; we have certain
parsnips, party of the fourth part. It is alleged by
the party of the first part that the party of the second
part did feloniously steal, make away with and confiscate
the party of the third part because said Duffy
alleges said General Grant did unlawfully eat, devour
and consume or cause to be consumed the party of
the fourth part. The plaintiff contends that he can
prove an alibi for the aforementioned General Grant
and that the said General Grant is innocent of the
overt act imputed to him by the party of the second
part. Is that not correctly stated, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” said Ug, by now dizzy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wigmore consulted a book weighing ten
pounds. For minutes he regarded the pages darkly.
Then he spoke:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hur-r-rumph! To speak <span class='it'>ex capite</span>, your case is
not unlike the case of Bullpitt <span class='it'>versus</span> Nudd, 67 Rhode
Island, 478, in which the honorable court ruled that
the unlawful abduction of animals was <span class='it'>contra bonos
mores</span>; and, if I remember correctly—and I think
I do—fined the defendant two dollars and costs.
Your case, sir, clearly involves a definition of <span class='it'>meum</span>
and <span class='it'>tuum</span>; and, speaking <span class='it'>cum grano salis</span>, it has a
precedent, if my memory is not at fault, and I do not
believe it is, in the case of the International Knitted
Knight Klose Korporation <span class='it'>versus</span> Gumbel <span class='it'>et al.</span>, 544
South Carolina, 69, although I must warn you that it
will be a question of adjudication just how far the
doctrine of <span class='it'>caveat emptor</span> conflicts with that of <span class='it'>cave
canem</span>. You can see that for yourself, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ug, utterly numb of brain, nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wigmore thoughtfully rubbed a bony chin
with a thumb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Inter se</span>,” he observed, “it will take much study
to determine what your remedy is. Your pig was
caught <span class='it'>in flagrante delicto</span>, according to the defendant,
which would make him <span class='it'>particeps criminis</span>, would it
not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ug gulped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might,” said Mr. Wigmore, “be possible to
obtain a writ of <span class='it'>habeas corpus</span>. Or again we might
have the defendant indicted for abduction. Possibly
a question of riparian rights is involved. I
hesitate to say without consulting an authority on
torts. Have you ten dollars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ug had. He produced it and saw it vanish into
a recess beneath the tails of Mr. Wigmore’s long
coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray wait here,” said Mr. Wigmore, “while I go
into conference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wigmore went into the other room and the
door closed behind him. He watched the men pitching
horseshoes in the street below for ten minutes,
and then returned, with grave face, to the sanctum
where Ug waited, perspiring freely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear sir,” said Mr. Wigmore blandly, “my
advice to you is—drop the case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ug stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And not get my pig back?” he quavered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What,” said Mr. Wigmore philosophically, “is
a pig more or less in the cosmic scheme?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he’s mine! I want my pig!” Ug was nearly
in tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possession,” remarked Mr. Wigmore, showing
impatience, “is nine points of the law. You came
to me for advice. I gave it to you. You have received
it. The law says nothing that would help you.
Forget the pig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that isn’t fair! He’s mine! Patsy Duffy is
a thief!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wigmore grew stern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take care, young man,” he said. “There are
laws against slander. Mr. Duffy is a respected
member of this community. His brother is the sheriff,
his brother-in-law is the county judge and his son
is the district attorney. Good afternoon. What a
bright warm day it is, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ug found himself on Main Street, stunned. He
had appealed to the law and it had failed him. It
didn’t seem possible that so learned a man as Marcellus
Q. Wigmore could be wrong, and yet Ug found
himself embracing that heresy. It seemed to him that
he had a right to get his pig back. He decided to
appeal to another of Uncle Sam’s representatives,
the superintendent of the reservation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a genial soul, the superintendent, who professed
often and loudly a love for the Indians. The
winds of politics had wafted him from his cigar store
in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where Indians, except
wooden ones, are something of a rarity, to his present
position. He greeted Ug warmly, almost affectionately,
slapped his back and asked after his health. Ug
replied that he was in a persecuted state of mind,
and pigless, and narrated the story of the loss of
General Grant. The superintendent was horrified,
sympathetic, indignant simultaneously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How dare this fellow Duffy take the property of
one of my Indians?” he demanded with heat. “I’ll
show him! Now don’t you worry, young fellow. I’ll
take this matter up myself, personally, see?” And
he patted Ug out of the office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ug waited a week. But his pig was not returned.
He summoned up his courage, bathed his rubber collar,
and once more tremulously visited the superintendent.
As he approached the office he noted that the
superintendent was busy with some visitor. Ug
paused in his approach. He could see the visitor
now. There was no mistaking that beacon light of
red hair and those haystack shoulders. Ug grinned;
doubtless at that very moment the superintendent was
castigating Duffy for purloining the pig. Then Ug
perceived that that could hardly be the case, for Mr.
Duffy emitted a bull bellow of a laugh, and Ug
heard with dismay that the superintendent laughed
with him. Ug crept nearer the window. He saw
that on the table between the two men were cards
and piles of chips and a brown bottle. Ug departed
as softly as he had come. He did not go back to the
superintendent again. Somehow he had divined that
it would be of no avail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went to the teacher. What could he do now?
Write to one of the men in Washington to whom
Uncle Sam had intrusted the task of looking after
the Indians, the teacher suggested. Ug returned to
his cabin and struggled with pen, ink and paper all
evening. By morning he had produced a smeary
note:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<div class='lgl' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>Indian Commissioner,</p>
<p class='line'>Washington, D. C.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Hon. sir</span>: I had pig—boughten by me for $3.45. His
name was General Grant. Patsy Duffy stealed him. General
Grant did not et them parsnips. He hates parsnips
worse than the dickens. White man has not right to take
Indian pig I guess. I want my pig back. Please tell Uncle
Sam.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>Your loving son,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>George Washington Ug</span></p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>Flatfoot Indian.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Having dispatched this missive, Ug waited quietly,
and with assurance. From time to time he glanced at
the Atlantic Fleet, and reflected with pride that at
a word from him that terrible machinery would be
set in motion against that red-headed Duffy man.
In eleven days he received a letter—a long, important-looking
document with an eagle in the corner.
Excitedly he tore it open. It read:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Dear sir</span>: In reply refer to No. 73965435, file 4534, section

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>Department of the Interior.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Ug was not entirely pleased by the letter. He
had hoped for a short, firm order to Patrick Duffy
that would lead to the immediate restitution of his
pig. Then, too, there was something so cool, aloof,
impersonal about it, considering that he was a relative
of Uncle Sam. He wondered how long “in
due course” was. When it proved to be more than
two weeks Ug, growing restive, wrote a post card
to the Indian commissioner:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Hon. sir</span>: How about my pig?</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>Your loving son,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>Flatfoot Indian.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He received a reply in a week:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Dear sir</span>: In reply refer to No. 656565, drawer; pig.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>Chief Clerk of the Bureau of Missing Animals.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Ug groaned aloud when he read this. He bought
a fresh bottle of ink and gave himself over for
two days to the arduous task of literary composition.
The letter he sent away to Washington read:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Hon. sir</span>: Now look here please. I am good little Indian.
I had pig. Name, General Grant. Patsy Duffy, bad man
but white, he steal that pig. He say G. Grant et his parsnips.

am sibbleized. Please tell Uncle Sam I want back my pig.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Ten days later a very fat letter came for Ug, and
he took it triumphantly. He even bought a can of
condensed milk for General Grant’s home-coming
party. In his cabin he opened the letter. It read:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It took Ug three days, seven pens, two bottles of
ink—one spilled—two smeared shirts and much
grunting to answer the questions, but answer them
he did. He mailed the letter and waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indian Bureau replied in two weeks that his
communication had been received and given careful
attention; but, inasmuch as it appeared to involve a
pig, it had been referred to the Department of Agriculture.
The secretary to the secretary to the Secretary
of Agriculture wrote Ug that the case had been
referred to the Bureau of Animal Husbandry. Ug,
puzzled, sent a hasty post card to say that General
Grant had no husband, but this information was
ignored. Instead, he received a letter saying that because
of the legal aspects of the case it had been
passed on to the Department of Justice. Ug sighed
and waited. The Department of Justice referred the
case, it notified Ug, to the ninth assistant attorney-general,
who gave it some days of study and sent
it back to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who
wrote Ug to know if it was a pig or a rig that he
had lost. Ug wrote “Pig, Pig, Pig!” on a post card
and sent it to Washington. Day followed day. No
letter came to Ug. He finally could stand delay no
longer. He decided one night to play his trump card.
He wrote to Uncle Sam:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Dear Uncle Sam</span>: You know me. I am George Washington
Ug, a very sibbleized good Indian; wear derby hat; go
church; say prayers; don’t fight. Now this Patsy Duffy,
bad white man, took my pig, General Grant, and I don’t
know how he get that way. Please send large gunboats
and make Patsy Duffy give back my pig please.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>Your loving neffew,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>George</span>,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>Flatfoot.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Doubts, worries, irritations melted away as Ug
read and reread his letter. It was all up with Patsy
Duffy now. Uncle Sam could not resist that letter,
even if it did involve less than one million pigs. It
involved an injustice to his ward, and Uncle Sam
would not permit that. Ug smiled as he wrote on
the envelop in his big, round scraggly hand, “Uncle
Sam, Washington, D. C.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reply came more promptly than replies to
any of his other letters; Ug knew it would. He picked
up the official envelop almost reverently. He carried
it past the other Indians in his hand. He wanted
them to see that he, Ug, had received a letter from
his Uncle Sam. He postponed the pleasure of opening
it, just as a child saves the best cake till last. He
opened it after some blissful reverie in his own cabin.
As he read it the brown face of Ug became like a
cup of coffee to which a great deal of milk has suddenly
been added. The letter was short, formal. It
was from the Post Office Department, and it read:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>No such person as Uncle Sam is known in Washington,
D. C. In the future please give full name and street and
number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ug felt as if he had been tomahawked. He took
himself, his dismay and his <span class='it'>café-au-lait</span> face to the
teacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is Uncle Sam’s last name?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The teacher didn’t know. Ug had caught him in
an unguarded moment; the admission had slipped
out; the teacher flushed, flustered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is Uncle Sam’s street and number?” asked
Ug. His small eyes now held suspicion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The teacher didn’t know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ug,” he said in his most kindly manner, “you’re
a grown man now. I think, perhaps, I ought to tell
you. Uncle Sam isn’t a man; that is to say, he isn’t
like you or me. He’s a sort of—well, a sort of
spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like God?” asked Ug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Not like God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like Santa Claus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes; that’s it,” said the teacher hastily.
“Rather more like Santa Claus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Teacher,” said Ug, and his face was as set as
a totem pole, “three years ago you told me that there
was no Santa Claus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The teacher looked away from Ug. The subject
was very unpleasant to the teacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been a good boy, Ug,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve tried to be,” said Ug, picking up his derby
hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Homeward through a quiet evening went Ug, very
slowly; his square head was bent forward till his
chin obscured his rubber collar; the path across the
meadow was well defined by the rising moon, but
Ug’s feet now and then strayed from it; he walked
like a man very tired. Not far from his small red,
white and blue cabin Ug stopped short. Something
was moving in the grass near the path. Ug bent toward
it. It was a large, glistening, red earthworm.
Ug’s hands went up to his head, and when they came
down one of them held his derby hat. A sharp motion
and the hat went skimming out into the alfalfa. A
hen, the property of a white neighbor, disturbed in
her beauty sleep, cackled. Ug made other sharp
motions. One of them stripped off his blue-serge
pants. Another ended the earthly days of the hen
by quick and vigorous strangulation. Still another
plucked out the feathers; and yet another nipped
the earthworm by the nape of its slimy neck before
it could slither back into its burrow. Then the quiet
night heard sounds—the sounds of a wild martial
chant in a barbarous tongue:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The owls and the gophers, the only witnesses, saw
a plump square-headed man, with feathers in his hair,
a knife in one hand and a wriggling worm in the
other, twisting and turning and dancing a primitive
abandoned dance in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patsy Duffy, smoking his corncob on his porch
in the cool of the evening, heard the distant sounds
too. He heard them draw nearer. He did not understand
what was happening till a fantastic figure
bounded, as if it were India rubber, to his porch. He
recognized Ug. It was not the Ug he had known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an Ug with eyes that blazed, an Ug that spoke
the chopped untutored speech of his ancestors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the devil!” growled Patsy Duffy, starting
up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“White man, you steal um pig! Me heap bad
Injun! You give um pig or you catch hell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll boot you——” began Patsy Duffy, but he
had no chance to finish his threat. Ug was on him,
clawing him like a demon; one brown hand gripped
the red hair, the other flourished the long-bladed
jackknife. Down they went, with Ug on top. A shrill
cry like the note of a drunken whippoorwill caught
in a buzz saw cut the night; his breath and his spirit
deserted Patrick Duffy; he knew that cry; years and
years ago it had struck cold fear to the hearts of
white pioneers; it was the war whoop of the Flatfeet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You let me up!” sniveled Patrick Duffy. “I was
just havin’ a little joke with you; honest I was, Ug.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even a braver man might well have been cowed by
the ferocity of a Flatfoot on the warpath. Ug rose.
He scowled at the prostrate Duffy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“White man,” said Ug, “if I catch you near my
tepee I’ll scalp you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ug knew from Patrick Duffy’s eyes that that
eventuality would never occur.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Across the moonlit meadow a figure made its way;
in shape it was not unlike a hot-water bag at high
tide. Certain feathers in its hair cast grotesque
shadows; it went forward with a conquering swagger,
and this was no mean feat, considering that the
figure held clasped tight in its arms a fat, squirming
pig.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch11'>THE MAN WHO COULD IMITATE A BEE</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>T was not until his twenty-second year that Hervey
Deyo realized that he was taking life too
seriously. Then the realization struck him sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been a serious infant and had nursed more
from a sense of duty than pleasure; his juvenile
marble and hoop games had been grave affairs, conducted
with nicety and decorum; he learned to read
shortly after he was breeched and at seven presented
a slip at the public library for the Encyclopedia from
A to Z. The librarian demurred, but he gently insisted;
he was permitted to carry it home volume by
volume. At twelve he had resolved to be a scientist
and furthermore a great scientist. He determined
to pursue the career of ornithologist; there was something
so dignified and withal scientific about a science
that called the sparrow <span class='it'>Passer Domesticus</span> and the
robin <span class='it'>Erithacus Rubecula</span>. He made rapid progress.
On his thirteenth birthday he took a bird walk at
dawn and was able to record in his note-book the
scientific names of forty-nine birds, including the
ruby-and-topaz humming-bird (<span class='it'>Chrysolampis Mosquitus</span>)
which is rare around Boston.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At fifteen he wrote a daring monograph which
proved beyond cavil that it would be possible to
revivify the extinct great auk (<span class='it'>Plautus Impennis</span>)
by a judicious and protracted series of matings between
the penguin (<span class='it'>Sphenisciformes</span>) and the ostrich
(<span class='it'>Struthio Camelus</span>). This theory was hotly challenged
by a German savant in a seventy thousand
word exegesis; Hervey Deyo crushed him under a
hundred thousand word rejoinder and thus at a
tender age came to enjoy a certain decent celebrity
in the world of ornithology. At seventeen, still in
the University, he was becoming known as a first-rate
all-round bird man; he rather looked down on
old Fodd at the Natural History Museum who was
a beetle man and particularly on Armbuster who
was a mere bee man; yes, Armbuster and his bees
decidedly wearied Hervey Deyo. As if bees counted!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something revolutionary happened to him in the
spring of his twenty-second year. The mild spring
evenings, biology, inexorable Nature conspired
against him; his mind began to reach out for contacts
with new things outside the world of birds.
He made the disturbing discovery that he could be
interested in things unfeathered; girls, for example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made this discovery at a tea to which he had
gone, most reluctantly, with his mother, who was
intensely serious about her social duties. He found
himself sitting on a divan beside a girl; her hair was
blonde and bobbed and she had an attentive little
smile. To be polite, he explained to her the essential
differences between the European redstart
(<span class='it'>Phœnicurus Phœnicurus</span>) and its cousin, the American
flycatching warbler (<span class='it'>Setophaga Ruticilla</span>). As
he talked the notion grew on him that teas were not
the bore he had thought them. It disconcerted him
when the girl rather abruptly left him to join a
fattish young man who had just entered. Hervey
Deyo could tell at a glance that the newcomer had
not the intellect to so much as stuff a lark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His alert mother spied his lonely state and steered
him to another corner and another girl. He sought
to fascinate her with an account of the curious circumstance
that the male loon (<span class='it'>Gavia Immer</span>) has three
more bones in his ankle than the female of that specie;
he told her this in strictest confidence, for it was
the very latest gossip of the world of ornithology.
He could not but note that after fifteen minutes her
attention seemed to wander. Presently she murmured
some vague excuse and slipped away to join
a laughing group in another part of the room. He
followed her flight with a glum eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The group appeared to have as its center the fattish
young man and it was growing distinctly
hilarious. Hervey Deyo had a pressing, but, he told
himself, wholly scientific interest in learning what
conversational charm or topic made the fattish young
man so much more interesting than himself. He
edged his chair within earshot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fattish young man was not talking; he appeared
to be making a series of odd noises through
his nose, varied now and then by throaty bellows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Norrrrrrrrrk. Norrrrrk. Wurrrrr. Wurrrrr.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trained ear of Hervey Deyo was puzzled;
clearly they were not bird noises, yet they had a
scientific sound; perhaps the fattish young man was
a scientist after all, a mammal man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Norrrrrrrrrk. Norrrrrk. Wurrrrr. Wurrrrr.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl with the attentive smile solved the mystery.
She called across the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Bernice, do come over here. You simply
must hear Mr. Mullett imitate a trained seal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hervey Deyo felt actually ill. So that was the
secret of Mr. Mullett’s powers; that was the magnet!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Norrrrrrrrr. Norrrrrk. Wurrrr. Wurrrr.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hervey Deyo couldn’t stand it. Stiffly he went
out and as he took his hat and stick he could still
hear the laughter and the fainter,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Norrrrrrrrr. Norrrrrk. Wurrrr. Wurrrr.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a fury of disgust he went to his laboratory and
so violently stuffed a grackle (<span class='it'>Euphagus Ferrugineus</span>)
that it burst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day he realized that something annoying
had happened, was happening to him; he could not
keep his mind on his work; it kept straying, despite
him, to the little girl with the attentive smile. She had
been interested in his talk of birds until the accomplished
Mr. Mullett, imitator of trained seals, had
made his untimely appearance. His teeth gritted
together at the thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That afternoon he surprised his mother by suggesting
that he accompany her to a tea; she was glad
his social consciousness seemed to be aroused at
last. They went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is Mr. Mullett?” he asked her as they rode
tea-ward in her motor car, a product of the seriousness
applied by Mr. Deyo, senior, to his brick business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Mullett? Why, he’s one of the Brookline
Mulletts,” his mother said. “Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he an animal man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; he sells insurance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He seems popular.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he has some parlor tricks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg pardon, mother? The allusion escapes
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parlor tricks,” repeated his mother. “He imitates
a trained seal; it appears to strike the younger
people as excessively comical. I believe he can also
swallow a lighted cigaret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hervey emitted a polite moan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must one do parlor tricks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have their uses,” said his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl with the attentive smile was at the tea
and Hervey Deyo captured her. Her name was
Mina Low. He was congratulating himself on having
interested her in his new monograph on parrakeet
bills, when she sprang up with a little cry of
pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mr. Deyo, there’s Ned Mullett. Let’s get
him to imitate a trained seal. He’s perfectly killing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know seals,” said Hervey Deyo, severely.
“They fail to attract me. I am a bird man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He left the tea with a heavy heart while the
talented Mullett was bellowing,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Norrrrrrrrrk. Norrrrrk. Wurrrr. Wurrrr.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lying in his bed that night the brain of Hervey
Deyo entertained two thoughts. One was that Miss
Low was a singularly charming girl; the other was
he could not interest her by birds alone. How then?
He analyzed the situation with the same care and
logic that he applied to the dissection of a humming-bird.
His conclusion was revolting but inescapable.
He must master a parlor trick. He shuddered
at the notion, but he was resolved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The end justifies the means,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose early and attacked the problem with the
weapons of science. In his note-book he carefully
wrote down all the animals and the sounds they
made, with comments and remarks on their value as
entertainment.</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='pindent'>He went through the list of the mammals and the
result was disappointing. None of them seemed so
interesting as a seal, and besides, he did not wish
to lay himself open to the charge of plagiarism. He
could not, of course, employ the calls of birds,
although he was rather good at that; it seemed sacrilegious
to employ ornithology as a parlor trick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his attention to the noises made by inanimate
things; he jotted down in his book “fog-horn,
buzzsaw, locomotive, saxophone.” He was considering
them with furrowed brow when Armbuster
agitatedly burst in. He disliked Armbuster; he gave
himself too many airs for a mere bee man; Hervey
considered it rather an imposition when Armbuster
was given an adjoining laboratory at the Museum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen her, Deyo?” cried Armbuster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her? Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My queen. She’s escaped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Hervey Deyo coldly. It was annoying
to have one’s thoughts broken in upon to be
asked about a wretched bee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you do see her, be sure to tell me,” said Armbuster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bee man vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hervey Deyo again bent over his note-book; he
added the words “dentist’s electric drill,” and was
considering whether Miss Low would regard an imitation
of it as unpleasant, when a faint sound caused
him to turn his head. A large bumblebee was
crawling up the window-pane grumbling to herself.
Hervey Deyo watched, listened. His first thought was
to capture her and return her to Armbuster, and
he reached out his hand toward her. She bumbled
noisily and eluded him. It came to him as a flash
of inspiration that his problem was solved. He’d
imitate a bee!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew it was not honorable to keep her, but he
did. He spent the afternoon chasing her up and
down the pane with a gloved hand; she muttered
and grumbled and buzzed. “<span class='it'>Bzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzzzzz,
bzzzzzzzz.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled a smile of grim triumph; what was a
trained seal’s raucous bellow to this? Softly he
imitated the sounds she made; patiently he practised;
before dusk came he was satisfied with the perfection
of his imitation, and yet not entirely satisfied.
The thing lacked a dramatic quality; it came to no
climax. He could buzz loudly and softly, angrily or
soothingly; but there was no grand finale. He felt
that one was needed; Mr. Mullett ended his seal imitation
with a crescendo roar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thought, murderous and ruthless, shot into one
of Hervey Deyo’s brain cells. Normally he was
neither murderous nor ruthless; quite gentle, indeed.
But love brings out the primal man; for the
sake of Mina Low he would, for a second, be atavistic.
He chased the protesting bee across the pane;
he got her into a corner; his gloved hand closed on
her; she buzzed frantically; he closed his thumb and
forefinger smartly together; he cut her off in full buzz
with a sharp incisive sound like a torch plunged into
a pond. A perfect climax! Hurriedly, furtively,
he fed her corpse to a live flamingo in a cage in the
corner. On his way home he passed Armbuster in
the hall; Armbuster was distractedly searching for
his queen; he was peering under a rug. Hervey
Deyo did not meet the bee man’s eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his room that night he practised assiduously
his new accomplishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzrf!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He attained perfection in that final shrill, staccato
“<span class='it'>bzzzzzrf</span>.” His mother, hearing the sounds, came
to the door to ask if he was ill. He called her in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzrf!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear,” she cried, “a bee! Where is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hervey bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am he,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He amazed his mother still more next day by
asking her to give a tea for him at the earliest opportunity.
He mentioned, matter-of-factly, that he
wouldn’t mind having her ask Miss Mina Low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He planned the seating scientifically; he saw to
it that he and Miss Low were seated together in a
quiet corner near a window. When she had finished
her first cup of tea, he turned to her suddenly, his
eyes excited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Miss Low. Look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzrf!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pretended to pursue an imaginary bee up the
window-pane and to catch him at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s a bee!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?” he asked, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s not really one. It was you. Oh, <span class='it'>do</span> do
it again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzrf!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She clapped her hands in ecstasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mr. Deyo, how perfectly wonderful! I didn’t
think you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do let me call the others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you wish,” said Hervey Deyo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They gathered about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bzzzzzzzzzzzzz, Bzzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzrf!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were enchanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do it again,” they begged. He did. With a
gracious smile Hervey Deyo acceded to their request.
He glowed. He was tasting the heady draught of
sudden popularity. Late arrivals at the tea were told
of his accomplishment; they insisted on hearing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzrf!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quite casual acquaintances came up to invite him
to their homes, to teas, to dinner parties. He smiled
and promised to come. From the corner of his eye
he could see that Miss Low was regarding him with
something very like interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went to a dinner party at the home of Professor
and Mrs. Murgatroyd; he had been stuffing an emu
(<span class='it'>Dromaeus Irroratus</span>) and it had so absorbed him
that he was late. He entered with the fish course
and the guests beamed expectantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, here is Mr. Deyo,” cried his hostess. “We
were so afraid you’d disappoint us. I’ve been telling
everyone about your perfectly delicious imitation of
a bee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He obliged them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzrf!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They encored him. One of the guests was the fattish
young man, Mr. Mullett, but the spotlight had
shifted from him and he sat eating morosely and regarding
Hervey Deyo with bilious, jealous eye. During
the dessert Mr. Mullett essayed to bark like a
seal, but Mrs. Murgatroyd looked at him disapprovingly
and he never reached the roared climax; he
buried his chagrin in the peche Melba. Hervey
Deyo, observing, smiled quietly to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner he had a tête-à-tête with Mina Low.
For her own special and private diversion he twice
repeated his imitation; on the second occasion he
ventured to take her hand and she pretended to be
so absorbed in the imitation that she did not notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three nights later he called on her at her home.
It was with difficulty that her young brothers were
finally dragged off to bed; the imitation fascinated
them and Hervey Deyo was forced to do it no less
than seven times. He was getting to be a virtuoso.
He could keep it up for five minutes at a time, now
pretending that the bee was in the lampshade, now
under a glass, now behind the piano, and even up
the pant leg of the youngest Low boy. When he and
Mina were at last alone together, he pretended that
the bee was buzzing very near her blonde, bobbed
hair; in capturing it, he kissed her. Their engagement
was announced the following Friday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The notice in the local newspaper pleased and
yet vaguely disturbed Hervey Deyo. It described him
thus: “Mr. Hervey Deyo is well known in local
society; he is a gifted scientist and has gained a reputation
for his ability to imitate a bee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he reread this he could not but feel that some
reference should have been made to the fact that he
was the author of an authoritative work on the cuckoo
(<span class='it'>Cuculus Canorus</span>), that he was a Doctor of Philosophy,
and that in the fall he was to become Chief
Curator of Birds in the Museum. Still, he reflected,
newspapers haven’t room to print everything; they
strive to print what to them are the salient facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and his fiancée went about a great deal
and the party at which Hervey Deyo did not give
his imitation of a bee was adjudged a sterile affair.
Frequently he congratulated himself in those days
that it took a man of science to know when to be
serious and when not to be. They were married
in August, and no less than seventeen friends sent
the happy pair various representations of bees as
wedding gifts; they received bronze bees, porcelain
bees, silver bees, gold bees, and a pewter bee; his
colleagues at the Museum gave him a handsome
bronze inkstand made to resemble a bee-hive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his return from his honeymoon, Hervey Deyo
threw himself into his bird labors at the Museum
with energy; he was a bird man, even a first-class
bird man, and so far his ambition was gratified;
but it still burned with a hot unappeased flame. He
wanted to be the biggest bird man in the world. However,
after his marriage he permitted himself certain
digressions from the relentless pursuit of this aim.
There was a constant demand for him socially and,
as Mina was fond of teas and parties and bridge
and balls, he found himself giving rather less time
to his birds than formerly. He was by no means
averse to a measure of social life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great scientist can afford to have his human
side,” he assured himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wherever he went with Mina, be it tea, party,
bridge, or ball, he was invariably pressed to give
his imitation of a bee. He would bow; he would
let them insist a bit; invariably he gave it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzrf!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No stranger ever came to the city who did not,
sooner or later, hear “that screamingly funny fellow,
Deyo, and his perfectly killing imitation of a bee.”
His fame spread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been married a number of years and had
a child or two when he came home one evening
visibly excited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” he called to his wife, his voice full of
excitement tinged with awe, “tonight I am to meet
Professor Schweeble. He just came to town. Think
of it! Karl Humperdinck Schweeble!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Schweeble?” said Mina, blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean to say you never heard of
Schweeble!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve spoken of him score of times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, perhaps you have,” she said, yawning. “I
thought he was a bird.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Schweeble is the biggest bird man in the
world,” he exclaimed. “It will be a big night in
ornithology when Schweeble and Deyo shake hands.
He must know my work; of course he must. He
can’t have missed that great auk monograph and the
cuckoo book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was so excited he could hardly tie his dinner
tie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Schweeble,” he kept repeating, “the great
Schweeble. I’ve wanted to meet him all my life. He
comes just at the right time, too, just when my paper
on the <span class='it'>Pyrrhula Europaea</span>—bull-finch, my dear—is
causing talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t forget your goloshes,” admonished Mina.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hervey Deyo, red, proud and flustered, was introduced
half an hour later to that great Bohemian
savant, Professor Schweeble, at the University Club.
Professor Schweeble made him a courtly bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charmed, Doctor Deyo,” he said. “I haff heard
much gebout you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hervey Deyo bowed deeply; he was warm and
crimson with pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, really?” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yezz,” said the distinguished visitor, “who haff
not heard of Deyo, the bee man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deyo .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the bee man!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?” Hervey Deyo was stunned, “I, a bee man?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon. Pardon many times. You are but too
modest,” said Professor Schweeble, wagging his index
finger at the stricken Deyo. “But surely you are
that same Deyo who makes the sound like the bee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hervey Deyo stuttered; he would have flung out
a denial. But the other scientists had gathered about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come, Deyo,” they urged him. “There’s a
good chap. Imitate a bee for the Professor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hervey bit his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How iss it?” encouraged Professor Schweeble.
“<span class='it'>Bzzzzzzz.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” cried Hervey Deyo, wildly. “Not like that.
Like this. ‘<span class='it'>Bzzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzrf!</span>’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, most droll,” said Professor Schweeble. “You
have talent; you are a comedian. You should go
on the stage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hervey Deyo could not articulate. Professor
Schweeble addressed him in the tone Hervey knew
so well, for he employed it often; it was the tone
of tolerance a scientist adopts to a layman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever taken an interest in birds, Doctor
Deyo? There are some fine birds a clever fellow
like you could learn to imitate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hervey Deyo did not enjoy that dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was up at daybreak and he attacked his work
with a cold and terrible energy. He stuffed a whole
family of bobolinks (<span class='it'>Dolichonyx Dryzivorus</span>) and
dissected snipe (<span class='it'>Gallinago</span>) by the dozen. He sat up
till his eyes ached writing a masterly treatise on the
habits and home life of the adult pelican (<span class='it'>Pelecanus</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deyo, the bee man, eh,” his lips kept saying.
“I’ll show ’em who’s a bee man. I’ll show ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he found it impossible to withdraw from social
life; the adulation he received as the most perfect
imitator of a bee extant had come to be necessary
to him; he continued to go out to social functions; he
continued to be asked to imitate a bee; he continued
to comply. Mina’s smile had less and less of an attentive
quality in it; she began to find excuses for
not going with him; but he insisted that it was her
duty; she could not give him adequate reasons for
evading it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was forty when he went down to New York
to attend a dinner—a very special dinner—of the
Ornithological Congress of the World, then in session.
For months he worked to prepare a paper that
would definitely place him at the head of his science,
now that Schweeble was no more. It was on the
mental habits of grouse (<span class='it'>Tetraoninae</span>). He rose to
read it, but some bibulous lesser bird man in the
rear of the hall called out, “Forget the grouse. Give
us the bee.” Others took up the cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forget the grouse. Give us the bee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole room took up the cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forget the grouse. Give us the bee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, the bee. We want the bee. We want
the bee. WE WANT THE BEE.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ornithologists have their light moods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He twisted the table-cloth in a great despair; a
furious refusal stuck in his throat; habit was stronger
than he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzrf!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sang “He’s a jolly good fellow which nobody
can deny.” A jolly good fellow! It was the
last thing in the world Hervey Deyo had ever wanted
to be. This, then, was his fame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He returned to his home city. His house was silent
when he entered it. On his desk was a note.</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Dear Hervey:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve taken the children and gone to live with Mother.
I love you as much as ever, but I can not live with a bee.
If I should hear you buzz just once more I should go mad
Don’t forget to put on your goloshes.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>Mina.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He went out of the house. Deliberately he did
not wear his goloshes; it was a slushy night. At
seven they took him to the hospital with a severe
case of influenza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning a careless nurse left a newspaper
where he could reach it. An item struck his eye.</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“Hervey Deyo is dangerously ill in St. Paul’s Hospital.
He is the man who can imitate a bee.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>When he read this, Hervey Deyo let the paper
slip from his fingers, and sank back on his pillow.
When the doctor came in, he found him lying staring
at the ceiling. A glance told the doctor that
Hervey Deyo had not long to live; the doctor sought
to rouse him from his torpor, to fan the flickering
flame of his interest; he turned on his professional
bedside smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said the doctor, “thinking about bees, I’ll
wager.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Hervey Deyo got out feebly, “not bees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, surely, I’m not mistaken. You are Deyo, the
famous bee man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hervey Deyo struggled to muster up vitality enough
to cry, “I’m a bird man.” But he could not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, now,” said the doctor, genially, “won’t
you imitate that bee for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hervey Deyo tried to glare a negative, but had
not the strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve heard so much about it,” said the doctor.
“And I’ve never heard you do it, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On a faint ebb of strength, Hervey Deyo managed
to say, “Really?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hervey Deyo with a final effort gathered together
all the little, last strength in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It—goes—like—this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzz bzzz bzz bzrf!</span>”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
